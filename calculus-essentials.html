Even for counting, we need<br>at least one other number, zero.<br><br>For instance, we may wish to count the number of right answers you may get on a<br>test, out of a possible 100. If you get 100, then all of your answers were<br>correct. If you get 0, then no answer was correct.<br><br>The positive integers and zero can be represented geometrically on a line, in a<br>manner similar to a ruler or a measuring stick.<br><br>For this we first have to select a unit of distance, say the inch, and then on<br>the line we mark off the inches to the right.<br><br>For convenience, it is useful to have a name for the positive integers together<br>with zero, and we shall call these the natural numbers. Thus 0 is a natural<br>number, so is 2, and so is 124,521. The natural numbers can be used to measure<br>distances, as with the ruler.<br><br>By definition, the point represented by 0 is called the origin. The natural<br>numbers can also be used to measure other things. For example, a thermometer is<br>like a ruler which measures temperature. <br><br>However, the thermometer shows us that<br>we encounter other types of numbers besides the natural numbers, because there<br>may be temperatures which may go below 0. Thus we encounter naturally what we<br>shall call negative integers which we call minus 1, minus 2, and so on and which<br>we write as:<br><br>-1, -2,-3, -4...<br><br>We represent the negative integers on a line as being on the other side of 0<br>from the positive numbers.<br><br>The positive integers, negative integers, and zero all together are called the<br>integers. Thus -9,0,10, -5 are all integers.<br><br>If we view the line as a thermometer, on which a unit of temperature has been<br>selected, say the degree Fahrenheit, then each integer represents a certain<br>temperature. The negative integers represent temperatures below zero.<br><br>Our discussion is already typical of many discussions which will occur,<br>concerning mathematical objects and their applicability to physical situations.<br>In the present instance, we have the integers as mathematical objects, which are<br>essentially abstract qualities.<br><br>We also have different applications for them, for instance measuring distance or<br>temperatures. These are of course not the only applications. Namely, we can use<br>the integers to measure time. We take the origin 0 to represent the year of the<br>birth of Christ. <br><br>Then the positive integers represent years after the birth of Christ, while the<br>negative integers can be used to represent BC years. With this convention, we<br>can say that the year -500 is the year 500 BC.<br><br>Adding a positive number, say 7, to another number, means that we must move 7<br>units to the right of the other number. For instance:<br><br>5 + 7 = 12.<br><br>Seven units to the right of 5 yields 12. On the thermometer, we would of course<br>be moving upward instead of right. For instance, if the temperature at a given<br>time is 5 and it goes up by 7, then the new temperature is 12.<br><br>Observe the very simple rule for addition with 0, namely:<br>\(0 + a = a + 0 = a\)<br><br>What about adding negative numbers? Look at the thermometer again. Suppose the<br>temperature at a given time is 10 degrees, and the temperature drops by 15<br>degrees. The new temperature is then -5 degrees, and we can write:<br>\(10 -15 = -5\)<br><br>Thus -5 is the result of subtracting 15 from 10, or of adding -15 to 10. In<br>terms of points on a line, adding a negative number, say -3, to another number<br>means that we must move 3 units to the left of this other number. For example:<br>\(5 + (-3) = 2\)<br>because starting with 5 and moving 3 units to the left yields 2. Similarly:<br>\(7 + (-3) = 4\) and \(3 + (-5) = -2\)<br>Note that we have:<br>\(3 + (-3) = 0\) or \(5 + (-5) = 0\).<br>We can also write these equations in the form:<br>\((-3) + 3 = 0\) or \((-5) + 5 = 0\).<br><br>For instance, if we start 3 units to the left of 0 and move 3 units to the<br>right, we get 0. Thus, in general, we have the formulas:<br>\(a + (-a) = 0\) and \(-a + a = 0\)<br><br>In the representation of integers on the line, this means that a and -a lie on<br>opposite sides of 0 on that line. We can now write:<br>\(3 = (-3)\) or \(5 = (-5)\)<br><br>We use the name 'minus a' for '-a' rather than the words 'negative a'. I find<br>the words 'negative a' confusing because they suggest that -a is a negative<br>number. This is not true unless a itself is positive. For instance:<br>\(3 = -(-3)\)<br>is a positive number, but 3 is equal to -a, where -a = -3, and a is a negative<br>number. Because of this property:<br>\(a + (-a) = 0\)<br>one also calls '-a' the additive inverse of 'a'.<br><br>The sum and product of integers are also integers.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1j1uf8ksie"><br><strong>Rules for Addition</strong></h2><p>integers follow very simple rules for addition. These are commutativity and<br>associativity.<br><br>Commutativity: If a,b are integers, then \(a + b = b + a\)<br>For instance, \(3 + 5 = 5 + 3\) or \(-2 + 5 = 3 = 5 + (-2)\)<br><br>Associativity: If a,b,c are integers then \((a + b) + c = a + (b + c)\)<br>In view of this, it is unnecessary to use parentheses in such a simple context,<br>and we simply write \(a + b + c\)<br>For instance: \((3 + 5) + 9 = 8 + 9 = 17\) and \(3 + (5 + 9) = 3 + 14 = 17\)<br>We write simply \(3 + 5 + 9 = 17\)<br><br>Associativity also holds with negative numbers. For example:<br>\((-2 + 5) + (-3) = -3 + (-3) = -6\) and \(2 + (-5 + (-3)) = 2 + (-8) = -6\)<br><br>The rules of addition mentioned above will not be proved, but we shall prove<br>other rules from them. Note that:<br>If a + b = 0 then b = -a and a = -b.<br>To prove this, add -a to both sides of the equation \(a + b = 0\).<br>We get \(-a + a + b = -a + 0 = -a\)<br>Since \(-a + a + b = 0 + b = b\) we find \(b = -a\).<br>Similarly, we find \(a = -b\). We could also conclude that \(-b = -(-a) = a\)<br>As a matter of convention, we shall write \(a - b\) instead of \(a + (-b)\).<br><br>Thus a sum involving three terms may be written in many ways, as follows:<br>\((a-b) + c = (a + (-b)) + c\) by associativity<br>\(= a + (-b + c)\) by commutativity<br>\( (a + c) - b\) by associativity<br>and we can also write this sum as: \(a - b + c = a + c - b\)<br>omitting the parentheses. Generally, in taking the sum of integers, we can take<br>the sum in any order by applying associativity and commutativity repeatedly.<br><br>As a special case, for any integer we have: \(a = -(-a))\).<br>This is true because \(a + (-a) = 0\)<br>and we can apply it with \(b = -a\). Remark that this formula is true whether<br>'a' is positve, negative, or 0. If 'a' is positive, then '-a' is negative. If<br>'a' is negative then '-a' is positive. In the geometric representation of<br>numbers on the line, 'a' and '-a' occur symmetrically on the line opposite sides<br>of 0. Of course, we can pile up minus signs and get other relationships, like:<br>\(-3 = -(-(-3))\) or \(3 = -(-3) = -(-(-(-3)))\)<br><br>Thus when we pile up the minus signs in front of 'a', we obtain 'a' or '-a'<br>alternatively. For the general formula with the appropriate notation.<br><br>For any integers 'a,b' we have \(-(a + b) = -a + (-b)\)<br>or, in other words \(-(a + b) = -a - b\)<br><br><strong>Proof:</strong> Remember that if 'x,y' are integers, then \(x = -y\) and \(y = -x\) mean<br>that \(x + y = 0\). Thus to prove our assertion, we must show that:<br>\((a + b) + (-a - b) = 0\)<br>This comes out immediately:<br>\((a + b) + (-a - b) = a + b - a - b\) by associativity<br>\(                   = a - a + b - b\) by commutativity<br>\(                   = 0 + 0        \)<br>\(                   = 0            \)<br>This proves our formula.<br><br><strong>Examples:</strong><br>\(-(3 + 5) = -3 - 5 = -8\)<br>\(-(-4 + 5) = -(-4) - 5 = 4 - 5 = -1\)<br>\(-(3 - 7) = -3 - (-7) = -3 + 7 = 4\)<br><br>You should be very careful when you take the negative of a sum which involves<br>itself in negative numbers, taking into account that:<br>\(-(-a) = a\)<br><br>The following rule concerning positive numbers is so natural that you probably<br>would not even think it worth while to take special notice of it. We will state<br>it explicitly:<br><br>"If a,b are positive integer, then a + b is also a positive integer."<br><br>For instance, 17 and 45 are positive numbers, and their sum, 62, is also a<br>positive integer.<br><br>We assume this rule concerning positivity. We shall see later that it also<br>applies to positive real numbers. From it we can prove:<br>"If a,b are negative integers, then a + b is negative."<br><br>Proof: We can write \(a = -n\) and \(b = -m\), where m and n are positive.<br>Therefore: \(a + b = -n - m = -(n + m)\)<br>which shows that 'a + b' is negative, because 'n + m' is positive.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong><br>If we have the relationship between three numbers,<br>\(a + b = c\)<br>then we can derive other relationships between them. For instance, add '-b' to<br>both sides of this equation and we get:<br>\(a + b - b = c - b\)<br>whence \(a + 0 = c - b\) or<br>\(a = c - b\)<br>Similarly, we can conclude \(b = c - a\)<br><br>For instance, if \(x + 3 = 5\)<br>then \(x = 5 - 3 = 2\)<br>if \(4 - a = 3\)<br>then adding 'a' to both sides yields \(4 = 3 + a\)<br>and subtracting 3 from both sides yields \(1 = a\)<br>If \(-2 - y = 5\)<br>then \(-7 = y\) or \( y = -7\)</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1j1uf8ksif"><br><strong>Rules for Multiplication</strong></h2><p>We can multiply integers, and the product of two integers is again an integer.<br>We shall list the rules which apply to multiplication and to its relation with<br>addition.<br><br>We again have the rules of commutivity and associativity:<br>\(ab = ba\) and \((ab)c = a(bc)\)<br><br>We emphasize that these apply whether 'a,b,c' are negative, positive, or zero.<br>Multiplication is also denoted by a dot. For instance:<br>\(3 \cdot 7 = 21\)<br>\((3 \cdot 7) \cdot 4 = 21 \cdot 4 = 84\)<br>\(3 \cdot (7 \cdot 4) = 3 \cdot 28 = 84\)<br><br>For any integer 'a', the rules of multiplication by 1 and 0 are:<br>\(1a = a\) and \(0a = 0\)<br><br><strong>Example:</strong><br>\((2a)(3b) = 2(a(3b))\)<br>\(         = 2(3a)b\)<br>\(         = (2 \cdot)ab\)<br>\(         = 6ab\)<br><br>In this example we have done something which is frequently useful, namely we<br>have moved to one side all the explicit numbers like '2,3' and put on the other<br>side those numbers denoted by a letter like 'a or b'. Using commutativity and<br>associativity, we can prove similarly:<br>\((5x)(7y) = 35xy\) or \((2a)(3b)(5x) = 30abx\)<br><br>We suggest that you carry out the proof of this equality completely, using<br>associativity and commutativity for multiplication.<br><br>Finally, we have the rule of distributivity, namely:<br>\(a(b + c) = ab + bc\) and \((b + c)a = ba + ca\)<br><br>These rules will not be proved, but will be used constantly. We shall, however,<br>make some comments on them, and prove other rules from them.<br><br>First, observe that if we just assume distributivity on one side, and assuming<br>distributivity on the left, we have:<br>\((b + c)a = a(b + c) = ab + ac = ba + ca\)<br>which is the proof of distributivity on the right.<br><br>Observe also that our rule \(0a = 0\) can be proved from the other rules<br>concerning multiplication and the properties of addition. We carry out the proof<br>as an example. We have:<br>\(0a + a = 0a + 1a = (0 + 1)a = 1a = a\)<br>So: \(0a + a = a\)<br>Adding '-a' to both sides, we obtain:<br>\(0a + a - a = a - a = 0\)<br><br>The left hand side is simply \(0a + a - a = 0a + 0 = 0a\)<br>so that we obtain \(0a = 0\) as desired.<br><br>We can also prove \((-1)a = -a\)<br>Proof: We have :<br>\((-1)a + a = (-1)a + 1a = (-1 + 1)a = 0a = 0\)<br>By definition, \((-1)a + a = 0\) means that \(-1)a = -a\), as was able to be<br>shown, \(-(ab) = (-a)b\)<br><br><strong>Proof:</strong></p><p>We must show that '(-a)b' is the negative of 'ab'. This amounts to<br>showing that \(ab + (-a)b = 0\)<br>But we have by distributivity \(ab + (-a)b = (a + (-a)b = 0b = 0\)<br>thus proving what we wanted. <br><br><strong>Examples:</strong><br>\(-(3a) = (-3)a = 3(-a)\)<br>\(4(a - 5b) = 4a - 20b\)<br>\(-3(5a - 7b) = -15a + 21b\)<br><br>In each of the above cases, you should indicate specifically each one of the<br>rules we have used to derive the desired equality. Again, we emphasize that you<br>should be especially careful when working with negative numbers and repeated<br>minus signs. This is one of the most frequent sources of error when we work with<br>multiplication and addition.<br><br><strong>Examples:</strong><br>\((-2a)(3b)(4c) = (-2) * 3 * 4abc = -24abc\)<br>\((-4x)(5y)(-3c) = (-4)5(-3)xyc = 60xyc\)<br>Note that the product of two minus signs gives a plus sign.<br><br><strong>Examples</strong><br>\((-1)(-1) = 1\)<br>To see this, all we have to do is apply our rule<br>\(-(ab) = (-a)b = a(-b)\)<br>Then we find:<br>\((-1)(-1) = -(1(-1)) = -(-1) = 1\)<br><br><strong>Example:</strong><br>More generally, for any integers 'a,b' we have:<br>\((-a)(-b) = ab\)<br><br>From this we can see that a product of two negative numbers is positive,<br>because, if 'a,b' are positive and '-a,-b' are therefore negative, then (-a)(-b)<br>is the positive number 'ab'. For instance, '-3' and '-5' are negative but<br>\((-3)(-5) = -(3(-5)) = -(-(3*5)) = 15\)<br><br><strong>Example</strong><br>A product of a negative number and a positive number is negative. For instance,,<br>'-4' is negative, '7' is positive, and <br>\((-4) * 7 = -(4*7) = -28\)<br>so that '(-4) * 7' is negative.<br><br>When we multiply a number with itself several times, it is convenient to use a<br>notation to abbreviate this operation. So we write:<br>\(aa = a^2\), \(aaa = a^3\), \(aaaa = a^4\)<br>and in general, if 'n' is a positive integer,<br>\(a^n = aa \codt \cdot \cdot a\) The product is taken 'n' times.<br>We say that \(a^n\) is the n-th power of 'a'. So \(a^2\) is the second power of<br>'a', and \(a^5\) is the fifth power of 'a'. If 'm,n' are positive integers,<br>then: \(a^{m+n} = a^ma^n\)<br><br>This simply states that if we take the product of 'a' with itself 'm+n' times,<br>then this amounts to taking the product of 'a' with itself 'm' times and<br>multiplying this with the product of 'a' with itself 'n' times.`<br><br><strong>Example</strong><br>\(a^2a^3 = (aa)(aaa) = a^{2+3} = aaaaa = a^5\)<br><br><strong>Example</strong><br>\((4x)^2 = 4x * 4x = 4 * 4xx = 16x^2\)<br><br><strong>Example</strong><br>\((7x)(2x)(5x) = 7 * 2 * 5xxx = 70x^3\)<br><br>We have this rule for powers,<br>\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\)<br><br>This means that if we take the product of 'a' with itself 'm' times, and then<br>take the product of \(a^m\) with itself 'n' times, then we obtain the product of<br>'a' with itself 'mn' times.<br><br><strong>Example</strong><br>\((a^3)^4 = a^12\)<br><br><strong>Example</strong><br>\((ab)^n = a^nb^n\)<br><br><strong>Example</strong><br>\(2a^3)^5 = 2^5(a^3)^5 = 32a^15\)<br><br><strong>Example</strong><br>The population of a city is 300 thousand in 1930, and doubles every 20 years.<br>What will be the population after 60 years?<br><br>This is a case of applying powers.

The odd integers<br>start with 1, and the even integers start with 2. Another way of describing an<br>even integer is to say that it is a positive integer which can be written in the<br>form 2n for some positive integer n. For instance, we can write:<br>\(2 = 2 * 1\)<br>\(4 = 2 * 2\)<br>\(6 = 2 * 3\)<br>\(8 = 2 * 4\)<br>and so on. Similarly, an odd integer is an integer which differs from an even<br>integer by 1, and so can be written in the form '2m-1' for some positive integer<br>m. <br><br>For instance:<br>\(1 = 2 * 1 - 1\)<br>\(3 = 2 * 2 - 1\)<br>\(5 = 2 * 3 - 1\)<br>\(7 = 2 * 4 - 1\)<br>\(8 = 2 * 5 - 1\)<br><br>Note that we can also write an odd integer in the form \(2n + 1\)<br>if we allow 'n' to be a natural number, allowing 'n = 0'. For instance, we can<br>have:<br>\(1 = 2 * 0 + 1\)<br>\(3 = 2 * 1 + 1\)<br>\(5 = 2 * 2 + 1\)<br>\(7 = 2 * 3 + 1\)<br>\(9 = 2 * 4 + 1\)<br><br>Theorem 1<br>Let 'a,b' be positive integers<br>If 'a' is even and 'b' is even, then 'a + b' is even<br>If 'a' is even and 'b' is odd, then 'a + b is odd <br>If 'a' is odd and 'b' is even, then 'a + b' is odd<br>If 'a' is odd and 'b' is odd, then 'a + b' is even<br><br>Proof<br>We shall prove the second statement. Assume that 'a' is even and that 'b' is<br>odd. Then we can write:<br>\(a = 2n\) and \(b = 2k + 1\) for some positive integer 'n' and some natural<br>number 'k'. Then:<br>\(a + b = 2n + 2k + 1 = 2(n + k) + 1 = 2m + 1\) (m = n + k)<br><br>This proves that \(a + b\) is odd.<br><br>Theorem 2<br>Let 'a' be a positive integer. If 'a' is even then \(a^2\) is even. If 'a' is<br>odd, then \(a^2\) is odd.<br><br>Proof<br>Assume that 'a' is even. This means that \(a = 2n\) for some positive integer<br>'n'. Then \(a^2 = 2n * 2n = 2(2n^2) = 2m\) where \(m = 2n^2\) is a positive<br>integer. So, \(a^2\) is even.<br><br>Next, assume that 'a' is odd, and write \(a = 2n + 1\) for some natural number<br>n. Then \(a^2 = (2n + 1)^2 = (2n)^2 + 2(2n)1 + 1^2\)<br>\(= 4n^2 + 4n + 1 = 2(2n^2 + 2n) + 1 = 2k + 1\) where \(k = 2n^2 + 2n\)<br>Hence, \(a^2\) is odd, so proving our theorem. <br><br>Corollary<br>Let 'a' be a positive integer. If \(a^2\) is even, then 'a' is even. If \(a^2\)<br>is odd, then 'a' is odd.<br><br>Proof<br>This is really only a reformulation of the theorem, taking into account ordinary<br>logic. If \(a^2\) is even, then 'a' cannot be odd because the square of an odd<br>number is odd. If \(a^2\) is odd, then 'a' cannot be even because the square of<br>an even number is even.<br><br>We can generalize the property used to define an even integer. Let 'd' be a<br>positive integer and let 'n' be an integer. We shall say that 'd' divides 'n',<br>or that 'n' is divisible by 'd' if we can write \(n = dk\) for some integer 'k'.<br>So an even integer is a positive integer which is divisible by 2. According to<br>our definition, the number 9 is divisible by 3 because \(9 = 3 * 3\).<br><br>Also, 15 is divisible by 3 because \(15 = 3 * 5\).<br>Also, -30 is divisible by 5 because \(-30 = 5(-6)\).<br>Note that every integer is divisible by 1, because we can always write:<br>\(n = 1 * n\)<br>Furthermore, every positive integer is divisible by itself.<br><br><br></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 6, 2025</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/calculus/">Calculus</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fcalculus-essentials.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fcalculus-essentials.html&amp;via=Science%20By%20Jason&amp;text=Learning%20Mathematics" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-essentials.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Fundamentals of Astronomy</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/latex-essentials.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Learning LaTeX </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-08-07T17:41" class="feed__date">August 7, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/introduction-to-precalculus.html" class="invert">Learning Pre-Calculus</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-08-09T10:33" class="feed__date">August 9, 2020</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/latex-essentials.html" class="invert">Learning LaTeX</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></script></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Jason Moore 2021</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
