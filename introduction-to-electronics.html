They control the current, switch it on and<br>off, change its fluctuations, direction, and timing in various ways to<br>accomplish a variety of functions.<br><br>The word electronics describes both the field of study that focuses on the control of<br>electrical energy and the physical systems that implement this control of<br>electrical energy. To understand what it means to control electric current, you<br>need a good working sense of what electric current is.<br><br>The term electricity can lead to confusion, even among scientists. Generally<br>speaking, electricity has to do with how certain types of particles in nature<br>interact with each other when in close proximity. <br><br>Electric charge is a fundamental property of certain particles that describes<br>how they interact with each other. There are two types of electric charges:<br>positive and negative. Particles of the same type repel each other, and<br>particles of the opposite type attract each other.<br><br>Electrical energy is a form of energy caused by the behavior of electrically<br>charged particles. <br><br>Electric current is the movement or flow of electrically charged particles. This<br>connotation of electricity is probably the one you are most used to.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Electric Current</strong></span><br>Electric current is the movement in the same direction of small, electrically<br>charged particles called electrons. <br><br>Atoms are the basic building blocks of everything. Every atom contains the<br>following types of subatomic particles:<br>1. Protons carry a positive electric charge and exist inside the nucleus or<br>center.<br>2. Neutrons have no electric charge and exist along with protons inside the<br>nucleus. and exist inside the nucleus or center.<br>3. Electrons carry a negative charge and are located outside the nucleus in an<br>electron cloud.<br><br>The specific combination of protons, electrons, and neutrons in an atom defines<br>the type of atom, and substances made up of just one type of atom and are known<br>as elements. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Charges</strong></span><br>Electric charge is a property of certain particles, such as electrons, protons,<br>and quarks that describes how they interact with each other. There are two<br>different types of electric charge, positive and negative. In general, particles<br>carrying the same type of charge repel each other, whereas particles carrying<br>opposite charges attract each other. Within each atom, the protons inside the<br>nucleus attract the electrons that are outside the nucleus.<br><br>You can experience the same attraction and repulsion with magnets. If you place<br>the north pole of a bar magnet near the south pole of a second bar magnet, you<br>will find that the magnets attract each other. If you place the same ends next<br>to each other they will repel each other.<br><br>Under normal circumstances, every atom has an equal number of protons and<br>electrons, and the atom is said to be electrically neutral. The attractive force<br>between the protons and electrons acts like invisible glue, holding the atoms<br>together, in much the same way that the gravitational force of the Earth keeps<br>the moon within sight.<br><br>The electrons closest to the nucleus are held to the atom with a stronger force<br>than the electrons farther from the nucleus. Some atoms hold on to their outer<br>electrons tightly, while others are a bit more lax. Just how tightly certain<br>atoms hold on to their electrons turns out to be important when it comes to<br>electricity. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Conductors and Insulators</strong></span><br>Materials such as copper, silver, and aluminum containing loosely bound outer<br>electrons are called electrical conductors. Copper is a good conductor because<br>it contains a single loosely bound electron in the outermost reaches of its<br>electron cloud. Materials that tend to keep their electrons close to home are<br>classified as electrical insulators. Air, glass, paper, and plastic are good<br>insulators, as are the rubber-like polymers that are used to insulate electrical<br>wires.<br><br>In conductors, the outer electrons of each atom are bound so loosely that many<br>of them break free and jump around from atom to atom. If you give these free<br>electrons a bit of a push in one direction, they will quickly get organized and<br>move together in the direction of the push.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Creating Current</strong></span><br>Electric current, called electricity, is the displacement of a large number of<br>electrons in the same direction through a conductor when an external force is<br>applied. That external force is known as voltage.<br><br>This flow of electric current appears to happen instantaneously. That is because<br>each free electron, from one end of a conductor to another, begins to move more<br>or less immediately, jumping from one atom to the next. So each atom<br>simultaneously loses one of its electrons to a neighboring atom and gains an<br>electron from another neighbor. The result of this cascade of jumping electrons<br>is what we observe as electric current.<br><br>The strength of an electric current is defined by how many charge carriers,<br>electrons, pass a fixed point in one second, and is measured in units called<br>amperes. One ampere is defined to be \(6.241*10^{18}\). Measuring electric current<br>is analogous to measuring water flow in gallons per minute. The symbol I is used<br>to represent the strength of an electric current. You could think of I as the<br>intensity of the electric current. <br><br>You may also hear the term coulomb used to describe the magnitude of the charge<br>carried by \(6.241*10^{18}\) electrons. A coulomb is related to an amp in that<br>one coulomb is the amount of charge carried by one amp of current in one second. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Voltage</strong></span><br>Electric current is the flow of negatively charged electrons through a conductor<br>when a force is applied. The force that pushes electrons along is technically<br>called an electromotive force, but it is more commonly known as voltage. You<br>measure voltage by using units called volts. Apply enough voltage to a<br>conductor, provide a complete path through which an electric charge can move,<br>and the free electrons in the conductor's atoms will move in the same direction.<br><br>Think of voltage as electric pressure. In much the same way water pressure<br>pushes water through pipes and valves, voltage pushes electrons through<br>conductors. The higher the water pressure, the stronger the push. The higher the<br>voltage, the stronger the electric current that flows through a conductor.<br><br>A voltage is simply a difference in electrical charge between two points. In a<br>battery, negatively charged atoms build up on one of two metal plates, and<br>positively charged atoms build up on the other plate, creating a voltage across<br>the plates. If you provide a conductive path between the metal plates, you<br>enable excess electrons to travel from one plate to the other, and current  will<br>flow in an effort to neutralize the charges. The electromotive force that<br>compels current to flow when the circuit is completed is created by the<br>difference between charges at the battery terminals.<br><br>You may also hear the terms potential difference, voltage potential, potential<br>drop, or voltage drop used to describe voltage. The word potential refers to the<br>possibility that a current may flow if you complete the circuit, and the words<br>drop and difference both refer to the difference in charge that creates the<br>voltage.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Electrical Energy</strong></span><br>As electrons travel through a conductor, they transport energy from one end of<br>the conductor to the other. Because like charges repel, each electron exerts a<br>non-contact repulsive force on the electron next to it, pushing that electron<br>along through the conductor. As a result, electrical energy is propagated<br>through the conductor. <br><br>If you can transport that energy to an object that allows work to be done on it,<br>such as a lightbulb, a motor, or a loudspeaker, you can put that energy to good<br>use. The electrical energy carried by the electrons is absorbed by the object<br>and transformed into another form of energy, such as light, heat, or motion.<br>That is how you make the bulb glow, rotate the motor shaft, or cause the<br>diaphragm of the speaker to vibrate and create sound.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Electrons</strong></span><br>To electrons delivering energy to a light bulb or other device, the word work<br>has real physical meaning. Work is a measure of the energy consumed by the<br>device over some time when a force(voltage) is applied to a bunch of electrons<br>in the device. The more electrons you push, and the harder you push them, the<br>more electrical energy is available and the more work can be done.<br><br>Power(P) is the total energy consumed in doing work over some period of time,<br>and it is measured in watts(W). Power is calculated by multiplying the<br>force(voltage) by the strength of the electron flow(current). <br>\(Power=voltage*current\)<br>\(P= V * I\)<br><br>The power equation is one of a handful of equations that you should really pay<br>attention to because of its importance in keeping from blowing things up. Every<br>electronic part, or component, has its limits when it comes to how much power it<br>can handle. If you energize too many electrons in a given component, you will<br>generate a lot of heat energy and you might fry that part. Many electronic<br>components come with maximum power ratings so you can avoid getting into a<br>heated situation. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Circuits</strong></span><br>Electric current does not just flow anywhere. Electrons flow only if you provide<br>a closed conductive path, known as an electrical circuit for them to move<br>through, and initiate the flow of a battery or other source of electrical<br>energy.<br><br>Every circuit needs at least three basic things to ensure that electrons get<br>energized and deliver their energy to something that needs work done.<br>1. Source of electrical energy: The source provides the voltage, or force, that<br>   nudges the electrons through the circuit. <br>2. Load: The load is something that absorbs electrical energy in a circuit.<br>   Think of the load as the destination for the electrical energy.<br>3. Path: A conductive path provides a conduit for electrons to flow between the<br>   source and the load. Copper and other conductors are commonly formed into the<br>   wire to provide this path.<br><br>An electric current starts with a push from the source and flows through the<br>wire path to the load, where electrical energy makes something happen and then<br>back to the other side of the source. Most often, other electronic parts are<br>also connected throughout the circuit to control the flow of current.<br><br>If you simply provide a conductive path in a closed loop that contains a power<br>source but no bulb, speaker, or other external load, you still have a circuit<br>and current will flow. In this case, the role of the load is played by the<br>resistance of the wire and the internal resistance of the battery, which<br>transfers the electrical energy into heat energy. Without an external load to<br>absorb some of the electrical energy, the heat energy can melt the insulation<br>around a wire or cause an explosion or release of dangerous chemicals from a<br>battery.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Supplying Electrical Energy</strong></span><br>If you take a copper wire and arrange it in a closed loop by twisting the ends<br>together, do you think the free electrons will flow well? The electrons might<br>move around a bit, because they are easy to move, but unless a force pushes the<br>electrons one way or another, you will not get current to flow.<br><br>Think about the motion of water that is just sitting in a closed pipe, the water<br>is not going to go through the pipe on its own. You need to introduce force, a<br>pressure differential, to deliver the energy needed to get a current flowing<br>through a pipe. Likewise, every circuit needs a source of electrical energy to<br>get the electrons flowing. Batteries and solar cells are common sources. The<br>electrical energy available at your wall outlets may come from one of many<br>different sources supplied by your power company.<br><br>Electrical energy is not created from scratch. It is generated by converting<br>another form of energy(mechanical, chemical, heat, or light) into electrical<br>energy. Exactly how electrical energy is generated by your favorite source turns<br>out to be important because different sources produce different types of<br>electric current. The two different types are:<br>1. Direct current(DC): A steady flow of electrons in one direction, with very<br>   little variation in the strength of the current. Cells(batteries) produce DC<br>   and most electronic circuits use DC.<br>2. Alternating Current(AC): A fluctuating flow of electrons that changes<br>   direction periodically. Power companies supply AC to your electrical outlets.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Direct Current</strong></span><br>A battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy through a process<br>called an electrochemical reaction. When two different metals are immersed in<br>certain chemicals, the metal atoms react with the chemical atoms to produce<br>charged atoms, known as ions. Negative ions build up on one metal plate, known<br>as an electrode. The difference in charge across the two electrodes creates a<br>voltage. That voltage is the force that electrons need to push them around a<br>circuit. <br><br>You might think that the oppositely charged ions would move toward each other<br>inside the battery, because opposite charges attract, but the chemicals inside<br>the battery act as a barrier to prevent this from happening. To use a battery in<br>a circuit, you connect one side of your load, for instance a light bulb, to the<br>negative terminal and the other side of your load to the positive terminal. A<br>terminal is just a piece of metal connected to an electrode to which you can<br>hook up wires. You have created a path that allows the charges to move, and<br>electrons flow from the negative terminal, through the circuit, to the positive<br>terminal. As they pass through the wire filament of the light bulb, some of the<br>electrical energy supplied by the battery is converted to light and heat,<br>causing the filament to glow and get warm. <br><br>The electrons keep flowing as long as the battery is connected in a circuit and<br>the electrochemical reactions continue to take place. As the chemicals become<br>depleted, fewer reactions take place, and the battery's voltage starts to drop.<br>Eventually, the battery can no longer generate electrical energy, and we say<br>that the battery is dead.<br><br>Because the electrons move in only one direction, from the negative terminal<br>through the circuit and to the positive terminal, the electric current generated<br>by a battery is DC. The AAA, AA, C, and D sizes you can buy anywhere  each<br>generate around 1.5 volts. The difference in size among those batteries has to<br>do with how much current can be drawn, and the longer it will last. Larger<br>batteries can handle heavier loads, which is just a way of saying they can<br>provide more power, so they can do more work.<br><br>Technically speaking, an individual battery isn't really a battery, it is a<br>cell. If you connect several cells together, as you often do in flashlights and<br>toys, then you have created a battery. The battery in your car is made up of six<br>cells, each generating 2-2.1 volts, connected together to produce 12-12.6 volts<br>total.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Alternating Current</strong></span><br>When you plug a light into an electrical outlet in your home, you are using<br>electrical energy that originated at a generating plant. Generating plants<br>process natural resources, like water, coal, oil, natural gas, or uranium,<br>through several steps to produce electrical energy. Electrical energy is said to<br>be a secondary energy source because it is generated through the conversion of a<br>primary energy source. <br><br>The electric current generated by power plants fluctuates, or changes direction,<br>at a regular rate known as the frequency. In the US and Canada, that rate is 60<br>times a second, or 60 hertz, but in most European countries, AC is generated at<br>50 Hz. The electricity supplied by your average wall outlet is said to be 120<br>volts AC, which just means it is alternating current at 120 volts.<br><br>Heaters, lamps, hair dryers, and other things are among the electrical devices<br>that use 120 volts AC directly. Clothes dryers, which require more power, use<br>240 volts AC directly from a special wall outlet. <br><br>Tablets, computers, cellphones, and other electronic devices require a steady DC<br>supply, so if you are using AC to supply an electronic device or circuit, you<br>will need to convert AC to DC. Regulated power supplies, known as ac-to-dc<br>converters, or AC adapters, do not actually supply power, they convert AC to DC<br>and are commonly included with electronic devices when purchased. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Transforming Light</strong></span><br>Solar cells, also known as photovoltaic cells, produce a small voltage when you<br>shine light on them. They are made from semiconductors, which are materials that<br>are somewhere between conductors and insulators in terms of their willingness to<br>give up their electrons. The amount of voltage is produced by a solar cell is<br>fairly constant, no matter how much light you shine on it. However, the strength<br>of the current you can draw depends on the intensity of the light. The brighter<br>the light, the higher the strength of the available current.<br><br>Solar cells have wires attached to two terminals for conducting electrons<br>through circuits, so you can power your calculator or the garden lights that<br>frame your walkway. Solar panels are becoming increasingly popular for supplying<br>electrical power to homes and businesses. If you scour the internet you will<br>find lots of information on how you can make your own solar panels.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Battery Symbols</strong></span><br>In the battery symbol, the plus sign signifies the positive terminal(cathode)<br>and the minus sign signifies the negative terminal(anode). Usually the battery's<br>voltage is shown alongside the symbol. The sine wave in the symbol for an AC<br>voltage source is a reminder that the voltage varies up and down. In the symbols<br>for a photovoltaic cell, the two arrows pointing towards the battery symbol<br>signify light energy.<br><br>Electronics is all about using specialized devices known as electronic<br>components(switches, resistors, capacitors, inductors, and transistors) to<br>control current in such a way that a specific function is performed. The nice<br>thing is that after you understand how a few individual electronic components<br>work and how to apply some basic principles, you can begin to understand and<br>build interesting electronic circuits.<br><br>Electronic components in your car and audio systems convert electrical energy<br>into sound energy. In each case, the system's speakers are the load or<br>destination for electrical energy. The job of the electronic components in the<br>system is to shape the current flowing to the speakers so that the diaphragm<br>within each speaker moves in such a way as to reproduce the original sound.<br><br>In visual systems, electronic components control the timing and intensity of<br>light emissions. Many remote control devices, such as the tv remote, emit<br>infrared light when your press a button, and the specific patterns of the<br>emitted light acts as a sort of code that is understood by the device you are<br>controlling. A circuit in your tv detects the infrared light and decodes the<br>instructions sent by the remote.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Sensing Signals</strong></span><br>Electronics can be used to make something happen in response to a specific level<br>or absence of light, heat, sound, or motion. Electronic sensors generate or<br>change an electrical current in response to a stimulus. <br><br>A common use of electronics is to control the on/off activity and speed of<br>motors. By connecting various objects to motors, you can use electronics to<br>control their motion.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 27, 2025</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/electronics/">electronics</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fintroduction-to-electronics.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fintroduction-to-electronics.html&amp;via=Science%20By%20Jason&amp;text=Introduction%20to%20Electronics" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/introduction-to-precalculus.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Learning Pre-Calculus</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-12-24T20:55" class="feed__date">December 24, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/biology-essentials.html" class="invert">Introduction to Biology</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-09-22T20:56" class="feed__date">September 22, 2020</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/physics-essentials.html" class="invert">Introduction to Physics</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></script></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Jason Moore 2021</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
