In college my classes were all full of prospective medical students and the occasional pharmacy major. So each class was full of hard workers. Despite having so many people around that were eager, some topics were hard to fully understand at first. DNA was one of these.</div><div></div><div>It stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. It is one of the first topics a biology student encounters that is unclear. It isn't really unclear though. It just does a lot of complicated things.

It is made up of the well known double helix you see plastic models of in all the labs.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Structure OF DNA</strong></span></h1><div>The structure is best described as a double helix as mentioned before. The strains are made up of a kind of sugar on the outside. The insides are nitrogen bases. They are all held together by hydrogen bonds. It is a double helix because there are 2 strands. The 2 strands are paired together using matching bases. It is like a miniature zipper with the way they are attached. This link describes the structure of DNA quite well.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><figure class="size-medium wp-image-35 aligncenter"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/dna1-300x108.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/dna1-300x108-xs.jpg 300w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/dna1-300x108-sm.jpg 480w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/dna1-300x108-md.jpg 768w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/dna1-300x108-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/dna1-300x108-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/dna1-300x108-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="dna1" data-aspectratio="2.777778" width="300" height="108"></figure></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bases Only Pair With Certain Other Bases</strong></span></h1><div>There are several types of bases in the helix. Those bases are adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine.  Adenine always pairs with thymine and guanine always pairs with cytosine. Adenine is a nucleobase and one of the bases in DNA. Its chemical formula is C5H5N5. It's pairing partner is thymine which is another nucleobase. It's chemical formula is C5H6N2O2. These 2 necleobases form in a strand of DNA. Guanine is another nucleobase. It only pairs with cytosine. It's formula is C5H5N5O. Cytosine is the last of the 4 major bases in DNA. It matches up with guanine exclusively.</div><div></div><div>It's formula is C4H5N3O. So another purpose of DNA is to split and reform into 2 cells which is replication. It does this by splitting apart these bases and then matching them up together again. Here is more information on these bases for the curious.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hereditary Information Gets Passed On to Generations</strong></span></h1><div>DNA is passed on from one generation to another. We inherit it from our parents. It determines who we are. We then, usually, pass it on by way of our offspring. The genetic information of DNA is contained in genes which are a part of DNA. There are often hundreds of genes in a strand of DNA. Each gene holds specific information that makes us who we are. DNA works in tandem with proteins to write out the genetic information.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><figure class="size-medium wp-image-36 aligncenter"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/dna2-300x83.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/dna2-300x83-xs.jpg 300w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/dna2-300x83-sm.jpg 480w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/dna2-300x83-md.jpg 768w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/dna2-300x83-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/dna2-300x83-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/dna2-300x83-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="dna2" data-aspectratio="3.614458" width="300" height="83"></figure></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DNA Controls Your Cells</strong></span></h1><div>It can do many things including controlling cells. This is vital because this is how major functions of the body occur.  It does this by being in a certain sequence. The sequence is all that matters. Everything is created by the sequences all of these bases make. Once it is done that is how bodily functions start. This purpose of DNA is one of the more important ones.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DNA Stores Genetic Information</strong></span></h1><div>DNA indeed does store genetic information. This allows for it to be passed on later. There is a lot of information that is stored. It is quite staggering actually.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><figure class="size-full wp-image-37 aligncenter"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/dna3.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/dna3-xs.jpg 300w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/dna3-sm.jpg 480w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/dna3-md.jpg 768w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/dna3-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/dna3-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/dna3-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="dna3" data-aspectratio="1.335052" width="259" height="194"></figure></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DNA Replicates Itself</strong></span></h1><div>DNA goes through replication when a cell divides. It uses special molecules called enzymes to help with the replication. The strands are separating during this process. Once they are separated another enzyme called DNA polymerase will copy each strand.</div><div></div><div></div><h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h1><div>The purpose of DNA is many fold. It controls cells along with replication. It passes on its genetic information to later generations. It determines who we are and the <a href="http://sciencebyjason.com/biology-for-beginners-themes-of-life/">life</a> we will have. It does a lot and we would do well to study it more to know what all it truly does.</div><div></div><div></div></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 14, 2019</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://ScienceByJason.com/biology/">Biology</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://ScienceByJason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://ScienceByJason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://ScienceByJason.com/how-modern-astronomy-evolved.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> How Modern Astronomy Evolved</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://ScienceByJason.com/blog.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Blog </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://ScienceByJason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2016-04-04T22:53" class="feed__date">April 4, 2016</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://ScienceByJason.com/what-are-star-classifications-and-their-life-cycles.html" class="invert">What Are Star Classifications And Their Life Cycles</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii Static CMS</a></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://ScienceByJason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
