The set of the first components of each ordered pair is called the range. consider the following set of ordered pairs.<br>The first numbers in each pair are the first five natural numbers. The second number in each pair is twice that of the first. <br>\(1,2  2,4  3,6  4,8  5,10\)<br>The domain is (1,2,3,4,5)<br>The range is (2,4,6,8,10)<br><br>Note that each value in the domain is also known as an input or independent<br>variable. It is often labeled with a lowercase x. Each value in the range is<br>also known as an output value or dependent variable. It is often labeled with<br>a lowercase y. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Functions</strong></span><br>A function f is a relation that assigns a single value in the range to each<br>value in the domain. In other words, no x-values are repeated. For our example<br>that relates the first five natural numbers to numbers double their value, this<br>relation is a function because each element in the domain (1,2,3,4,5) is<br>paired with exactly one element in the range (2,4,6,8,10).<br><br>Now lets consider the set of ordered pairs that relates the terms even<br>and odd to the first five natural numbers.<br>(odd,1) (even,2)  (odd,3)  (even,4)  (odd,5)<br><br>Notice that each element in the domain (even,odd) is not paired with exactly<br>one element in the range, (1,2,3,4,5). For example, the term odd corresponds<br>to three values from the range (1,3,5) and the term even corresponds to two<br>values from the range (2,4). This violates the definition of a function,<br>so this relation is not a function. <br><br>A function is a relation in which each possible input value leads to exactly<br>one output value. We say the output is a function of the input. The input<br>values make up the domain, and the output values make up the range. <br><br>To decide if a relation is a function. identify the input values, identify<br>the output values. then: if each input value leads to only one output value,<br>classify the relationship as a function. If any input value leads to two or<br>more outputs, do not classify the relationship as a function.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Function Notation</strong></span><br>Once that we determine that a relationship is a function, we need to<br>display and define the functional relationship so that we can understand and use<br>them, and sometimes also so that we can program them into computers. There are<br>various ways of representing functions. A standard function notation is one<br>representation that facilitates working with functions. <br><br>To represent height is a function of age, we start by identifying the<br>descriptive variables "h" for height and "a" for age. The letters f,g, and h,<br>are often used to represent functions. <br><br>h is f of a - We name the function f, height is a function of age.<br>h=f(a) - We use parentheses to indicate the function input.<br>f(a) - We name the function f, the expression is read as "f of a".<br><br>Remember that we can use any letter to name the function. The notation<br>h(a) shows us that h depends on a. The value a must be put into the function h<br>to get a result. The parentheses indicate that age is input into the function,<br>they do not indicate multiplication. <br><br>We can also give an algebraic expression as the input to a function. For<br>example, f(a+b) means first a and b, and the result is the input for the<br>function f. The operations must be performed in this order to obtain the<br>correct result.<br><br>The notation y=f(x) defines a function named f. This is read as "y is a<br>function of x". The letter x represents the input value or independent<br>variable. The letter y or f(x) represents the output value or dependent<br>variable.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span><br>Determine if menu price lists are functions.<br>Is the price a function of the item?<br>Is the item a function of the price?<br><br>Solution: <br>Let's begin by considering the input as the items on the menu. The<br>output values are then the prices. Each item on the menu has only one price,<br>so the price is a function of the item. <br><br>Two items on the menu have the same price. If we consider the prices to be<br>the input values and the items to be the output, then the same input value<br>could have more than one output associated with it. So, the item is not a<br>function of the price.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 2</strong></span><br>Determine if class grade rules are functions<br>In a particular math class, the overall percent grade corresponds to a grade<br>point average. Is grade point average a function of the percent grade? Is the<br>percent grade a function of the grade point average?<br><br>Solution:<br>For any percent grade earned, there is an associated grade point average, so<br>the grade point average is a function of the percent grade. In other words, if<br>we input the percent grade, the output is a specific grade point average. <br><br>In the grading system given, there is a range of percent grades that<br>correspond to the same grade point average. For example, students who<br>receive a grade point average of 3.0 could have a variety of percent grades<br>ranging from 78 all the way to 86. Thus, the percent grade is not a function<br>of grade point average.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 3</strong></span><br>Using function notation for days in a month<br>Use function notation to represent a function whose input is the name of a<br>month and output is the number of days in that month. Assume that the domain<br>does not include leap years.<br><br>Solution:<br>The number of days in a month is a function of the name of the month, so if<br>we name the function f, we write days=f(month) or d-f(m). The name of the<br>month is the input to a rule that associates a specific number(the<br>output) with each input. For example, f(march)=31, because march has 31<br>days. The notation d-f(m) reminds us that the number of days, d(output), is<br>dependent on the name of the month, m(input). <br><br>Note that the inputs to a function do not have to be numbers. Function inputs<br>can be the names of people, labels of geometric objects, or any other<br>element that determines some kind of output. However, most of the functions we<br>will work with in this book will have numbers as inputs and outputs. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 4</strong></span><br>Interpreting function notation<br>A function N=f(y) gives the number of police officers, N, in a town in year y.<br>What does f(2005)=300 represent?<br><br>Solution:<br>When we read f(2005)=300, we see that the input year is 2005. The value for<br>the output, the number of police officers(N), is 300. Remember N=f(y). The<br>statement f(2005)=300 tells us that in the year 2005 there were 300 police<br>officers in town.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Representing Functions Using Tables</strong></span><br>A common method of representing functions is in the form of a table. The<br>table rows or columns display the corresponding input and output values. in<br>some cases, these values represent all we know about the relationship.; other<br>times, the table provides a few select examples from a more complete<br>relationship.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Finding Input and Output Values of a Function</strong></span><br>When we know an input value and want to determine the corresponding output<br>value for a function, we evaluate the function. Evaluating will always<br>produce one result because each input of a function corresponds to exactly<br>one output value.<br><br>When we know an output value and want to determine the input values that would<br>produce that output value, we set the output equal to the function's formula<br>and solve for the input. Solving can produce more than one solution because<br>different input values can produce the same output value. <br><br>When we have a function in formula form, it is usually a simple matter to<br>evaluate the function. For example, the function \(f(x)=5-3x^2\) can be<br>evaluated by squaring the input value, multiplying by 3, and then subtracting<br>the product from 5.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 6</strong></span><br>Evaluate \(f(x)=x^2+3x-4\) for x=2<br><br>Solution:<br>\(f(x)=(2)^2 + 3(2) - 4\)<br>\(f(x)=4+6-4\)<br>\(f(x)=6\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 7</strong></span><br>Given the function \(h(p)=p^2+2p\) evaluate h(4)<br><br>Solution:<br>To evaluate h(4), we substitute the value 4 for the input variable p in the<br>given function.<br>\(h(p)=p^2+2p\)<br>\(h(4)=4^2+2(4)\)<br>\(=16+8\)<br>\(=24\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 8</strong></span><br>Given the function \(h(p)=p^2+2p\) solve for h(p)=3<br><br>Solution:<br>\(h(p)=3\)<br>\(p^2+2p=3\)<br>\(p^2+2p-3=0\)<br>\((p+3)(p-1)=0\)<br>p=-3,1<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Evaluating Function Expressed in Formulas</strong></span><br>Some functions are defined by mathematical rules or procedures expressed in<br>equation form. If it is possible to express the function output with a<br>formula involving the input quantity, then we can define a function in<br>algebraic form. For example, the equation \(2n+6p=12\) expresses a functional<br>relationship between n and p. We can rewrite it to decide if p is a function<br>of n. <br><br>Given a function in equation form, write its algebraic formula:<br>1. Solve the equation to isolate the output variable on one side of the equal<br>sign, with the other side as an expression that involves only the input<br>variable.<br>2. Use all the usual algebraic methods for solving equations, such as adding<br>or subtracting the same quantity to or from both sides, or multiplying or<br>dividing both sides of the equation by the same quantity. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 9</strong></span><br>Finding the Algebraic form of a Function<br>Express the relationship \(2n+6p=12\) as a function \(p=f(n)\) if possible.<br><br>Solution:<br>To express the relationship in this form, we need to be able to write the<br>relationship where p is a function of n, which means writing it as<br>p=[expression involving n].<br>\(2n+6p=12\)<br>\(6p=12-2n\)<br>\(p=\frac{12-2n}{6}\)<br>\(p=\frac{12}{6} - \frac{2n}{6}\)<br>\(p=2-\frac{1}{3}n\)<br><br>It is important to note that not every relationship expressed by an equation<br>can also be expressed as a function with a formula.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 10</strong></span><br>Expressing the Equation of a Circle as a Function<br>does the equation \(x^2+y^2=1\) represent a function with x as input and y as<br>output? If so, express the relationship as a function \(y=f(x)\).<br><br>Solution:<br>First we subtract \(x^2\) from both sides.<br>\(y^2=1-x^2\)<br>Now we try to solve for y in this equation<br>\(y=\pm \sqrt{1-x^2}\)<br>\(y=+ \sqrt{1-x^2} \text{ and} - \sqrt{1-x^2}\)<br>We get two outputs corresponding to the same input, so this relationship cannot<br>be represented as a single function \(y=f(x)\)<br><br>Are there relationships expressed by an equation that do represent a function<br>but which still cannot be represented by an algebraic formula?<br>Yes this can happen. For example, given the equation \(x=y+2^y\), if we want<br>to express y as a function of x, there is no simple algebraic formula<br>involving only x that equals y. However, each x does determine a unique value<br>for y, and there are mathematical procedures by which y can be found to any<br>desired accuracy. In this case, we say that the equation gives an<br>implicit rule for y as a function of x, even though the formula cannot be<br>written explicitly.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Evaluating a Function Given in Tabular Form</strong></span><br>As we saw above, we can represent functions in tables. Conversely, we can use<br>information in tables to write functions, and we can evaluate functions using<br>the tables. <br><br>Given a function represented by a table, identify specific output and input<br>values:<br>1. Find the given input in the row of input values<br>2. Identify the corresponding output value paired with that input value<br>3. Find the given output values in the row or column of output values, noting<br>every time that output value appears.<br>4. Identify the input value or values corresponding to the given output value.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 11</strong></span><br>Evaluating and Solving a Tabular Function<br>1. Evaluate g(3)<br>2. Solve \(g(n)=6\)<br><br>Solution:<br>Evaluating g(3) means determining the output value of the function g for the<br>input value of n=3. The table output value corresponding to n=3 is<br>7, so g(3)=7.<br><br>Solving g(n)=6 means identifying the input values n, that produce an output<br>value of 6. When we input 2 into the function g, our output is 6. When we<br>input 4 into the function g, our output is also 6.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Finding Function Values From a Graph</strong></span><br>Evaluating a function using a graph requires finding the corresponding value<br>for a given input value, only in this case, we find the output value by<br>looking at the graph. Solving a function equation using a graph requires<br>finding all instances of the given output value on the graph and observing the<br>corresponding input values.<br>1. Evaluate f(2)<br>2. Solve f(x)=4<br><br>Solution:<br>1. To evaluate f(2), locate the point on the curve where x=2, then read the<br>y-coordinate of that point. The point has coordinates of (2,1) so f(2)=1.<br>2. To solve f(x)=4, we find the output value 4 on the vertical axis. moving<br>horizontally along the line y=4, we locate two points of the curve with output<br>value 4:(-1,4) and (3,4). These points represent the two solutions to f(x)=4:<br>-1 or 3. This means f(-1)=4 and f(3)=4, or when the input is -1 or 3, the<br>output is 4.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Determining Whether a Function is One-to-One</strong></span><br>Some functions have a given output value that corresponds to two or<br>more input values. For example, in the stock chart shown, the stock price<br>was $1000 on five different dates, meaning that there were five different input<br>values that all resulted in the same output value of $1000.<br><br>However, some functions have only one input value for each output value, as<br>well as having only one output for each input. We call these functions<br>one-to-one functions. As an example, consider a school that uses only letter<br>grades and decimal equivalents.<br><br>This grading system represents a one to one function, because each letter input<br>yields one particular grade point average output and each grade point average<br>corresponds to one input letter.<br><br>To visualize this concept, let's look again at the two simple functions<br>sketched. The function in part 1 shows a relationship that is not a one to one<br>function because inputs q and r both give output n. The function in part 2<br>shows a relationship that is a one to one function because each input is<br>associated with a single output.<br><br>A one to one function is a function in which each output value corresponds<br>to exactly one input value.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 13</strong></span><br>Determining Whether a Relationship is a One to One function<br>Is the area of a circle a function of its radius? if yes, is the function one<br>to one?<br><br>Solution:<br>A circle of radius r has a unique area measure given by \(A=\pi r^2\) for any<br>input r, there is only one output. The area is a function of radius r.<br><br>If the function is one to one, the output value, the area, must correspond to<br>a unique input value, the radius. Any area measure A is given by the formula<br>\(A=\pi r^2\). Because areas and radii are positive numbers, there is exactly<br>one solution: \(\sqrt{A}{\pi}\). So the area of a circle is a one to one<br>function of the circle's radius. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Using the Vertical Line Test</strong></span><br>As we have seen in some examples above, we can represent a function<br>using a graph. Graphs display a great many input-output pairs in a small<br>space. The visual information they provide often makes relationships easier to<br>understand. by convention, graphs are typically constructed with the<br>input values along the horizontal axis and the output values along the vertical<br>axis.<br><br>The most common graphs name the input value y, and we say y is a function of x,<br>or y=f(x) when the function is named f. The graph of the function is the set<br>of all points (x,y) in the plane that satisfies the equation y=f(x). If the<br>function is defined for only a few input values, then the graph of the function<br>is only a few points, where the x-coordinate of each point is an input value<br>and the y-coordinate of each point is the corresponding output<br>value. for example, the black dots on the graph tell us that f(0)=2 and<br>f(6)=1. However, the set of all points (x,y) satisfying y=f(x) is a<br>curve. The curve includes (0,2) and (6,1) because the curve passes through<br>those points.<br><br>The vertical line test can be used to determine whether a graph<br>represents a function. If we can draw any vertical line that intersects a<br>graph more than once, then the graph does not define a function because a<br>function has only one output value for each input value.<br><br>Given a graph, use the vertical line test to determine if the graph represents a<br>function.<br>1. Inspect the graph to see if any vertical line drawn would intersect the curve<br>more than once.<br>2. If there is any such line, determine that the graph does not represent a<br>function.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 14</strong></span><br>Applying the vertical line test<br>Which of the graphs represent a function y=f(x)?<br><br>Solution:<br>If any vertical line intersects a graph more than once, the relation<br>represented by the graph is not a function. Notice that any vertical line<br>would pass through only one point of the two graphs shown in parts a and b.<br>From this we can conclude that these two graphs represent functions. The<br>third graph does not represent a function because, at most x-values, a vertical<br>line would intersect the graph at more than one point.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Using the Horizontal line test</strong></span><br>Once we have determined that a graph defines a function, an easy way to<br>determine if it is a one to one function is to use the horizontal line test. Draw<br>horizontal lines through the graph. If any horizontal line intersects the graph<br>more than once, then the graph does not represent a one to one function.<br><br>Given a graph of a function, use the horizontal line test to determine if the<br>graph represents a one to one function.<br>1. Inspect the graph to see if any horizontal line drawn would intersect the<br>curve more than once.<br>2. If there is any such line, determine that the function is not one to<br>one.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 15</strong></span><br>Applying the Horizontal Line Test<br>Consider the functions shown. Are either of the functions one to one?<br><br>Solution:<br>1. The function in part 1 is not one to one. The horizontal line shown<br>intersects the graph of the function at two points.<br>2. The function in part 2 is one to one. Any horizontal line will intersect a<br>diagonal line at most once.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Identifying Basic Toolkit Functions</strong></span><br>In this section, we will be exploring functions-the shapes of their graphs,<br>their unique characteristics, their algebraic formulas, and how to<br>solve problems with them. When learning to read, we start with the alphabet.<br>When learning to do arithmetic, we start with numbers. When working with<br>functions, it is similarly helpful to have a base set of building block<br>elements. We call these our toolkit functions, which form a set of basic named<br>functions for which we known the graph, formula, and special properties. Some<br>of these functions are programmed to individual buttons on many<br>calculators. For these definitions, we will use the x as the input variable and<br>y=f(x) as the output variable.<br><br>We will see these toolkit functions, combinations of toolkit functions, their<br>graphs, and their transformations frequently throughout this book. It<br>will be very helpful if we can recognize these toolkit functions and their<br>features quickly by name, formula, graph, and basic table properties.

We also need to consider what is<br>mathematically permitted. For example, we cannot include any input value<br>that leads us to take an even root of a negative number if the domain and<br>range consist of real numbers. Or in a function expressed as a formula,<br>we cannot include any input value in the domain that would lead us to divide<br>by 0.<br><br>We can visualize the domain as a holding area that contains raw materials<br>for a function machine and the range as another holding area for the<br>machine's products.<br><br>We can write the domain and range in interval notation, which uses<br>values within brackets to describe a set of numbers. In interval notation, we<br>use a square bracket when the set includes the endpoint and a<br>parenthesis to indicate the endpoint is either not included or the interval<br>is unbounded. For example, if a person has $100 to spend, they would need to<br>express the interval that is more than - and less than or equal to 100 and write<br>(0,100].<br><br>Let us turn our attention to finding the domain of a function whose equation<br>is provided. Oftentimes, finding the domain of such functions involves<br>remembering three different forms. First, if the function has no<br>denominator or an odd root, consider whether the domain could be all real<br>numbers. Second, if there is a denominator in the function's equation,<br>exclude values in the domain that force the denominator to be zero.<br>Third, if there is an even root, consider excluding values that would make<br>the radicand negative.<br><br>The smallest term from the interval is written first.<br>The largest term in the interval is written second, following a comma.<br>Parentheses are used to signify that an endpoint is not included, called<br>exclusive.<br>Brackets are used to indicate that an endpoint is included, called<br>inclusive.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span><br>Find the domain of the following function:<br>{(2,10), (3,10), (4,20), (5,30),(6,40)}<br><br>Solution:<br>First, identify the input values. The input value is the first coordinate in<br>an ordered pair. There are no restrictions, as the ordered pairs are simply<br>listed. The domain is the set of the first coordinates of the ordered pairs.<br>{2,3,4,5,6}<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 2</strong></span><br>Find the domain of the function \(f(x)=x^2-1\)<br><br>Solution:<br>The input value, shown by the variable x in the equation, is squared and<br>then the result is lowered by 1. Any real number may be squared and then be<br>lowered by 1, so there are no restrictions on the domain of this function.<br>The domain is the set of real numbers.<br>In interval form, the domain of f is: (-inf,inf)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 3</strong></span><br>Find the domain of the function: <br>\(f(x)=\frac{x+1}{2-x}\)<br><br>Solution:<br>When there is a denominator, we want to include only values that do not force<br>the denominator to be zero. So, we will set the denominator equal to 0<br>and solve for x.<br>\(2-x=0\)<br>\(-x=-2\)<br>\(x=2\)<br>Now, we will exclude 2 from the domain. The answers are all real numbers<br>where x&lt;2 or x&gt;2. We can use a symbol known as the union to combine the two<br>sets. In interval notation, we write the solution:<br>\((-\infty,2) \cup (2,\infty)\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 4</strong></span><br>Find the domain of the function \(f(x)=\sqrt{7-x}\).<br><br>Solution:<br>When there is an even root in the formula, we exclude any real numbers that<br>result in a negative number in the radicand.<br>Set the radicand greater than or equal to zero and solve for x<br>\(7-x \geq 0\)<br>\(-x \geq -7\)<br>\(x \leq 7\)<br>Now, we will exclude any number greater than 7 from the domain. The answers<br>are all real numbers less than or equal to 7.<br>\((-\infty,7)\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Can there be functions in which the domain and range do not intersect at all?</strong></span><br>Yes, for example, the function \(f(x)=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}\) has<br>the set of all positive real numbers as its domain but the set of all negative<br>real numbers as its range. As a more extreme example, a function's inputs and<br>outputs can be completely different categories, in such cases the domain and<br>range have no elements in common.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Using Notations to Specify Domain and Range</strong></span><br>In the previous examples, we used inequalities and lists to describe the<br>domain of functions. We can also use inequalities, or other statements that<br>might define sets of values or data, to describe the behavior of the variable<br>in set-builder notation. For example, \({x|10 \leq x &lt; 30}\) describes the<br>behavior of x in set-builder notation. The braces "{}" are read as "the set of",<br>and the vertical bar "|" is read as "such that" so we would read it as "the set<br>of x-values such that 10 is less than or equal to x, and x is less than 30."<br><br>Here are some examples of different notation:<br>\(5&lt;h\leq10\) : \({h|5&lt;h\leq10}\) : \(5,10]\)<br>\(5\leq h&lt;10\) : \({h|5\leq h&lt;10}\) : \([5,10)\)<br>\(5&lt;h&lt;10\)    : \({h|5&lt;h&lt;10}\)    : \((5,10)\)<br>\(h&lt;10\)      : \({h|h&lt;10}\)      : \((-\infty,10)\)<br>all numbers   : \({R}\)             : \((-\infty,\infty)\)<br><br>To combine two intervals using inequality notation or set-builder notation, we<br>use the word "or". As we saw in earlier examples, we use the union symbol,<br>\(\cup\), to combine two unconnected intervals. For example, the union of<br>sets {2,3,5} and {4,6} is the set {2,3,4,5,6}. It is the set of all elements<br>that belong to one or the other(or both) of the original two sets. For<br>sets with a finite number of elements like these, the elements do not have to<br>be listed in ascending order of numerical value. If the original two sets<br>have some elements in common, those elements should be listed only once in the<br>union set. For sets of real numbers on intervals, another example of a<br>union is: \({x| |x| \geq 3} = (-\infty,-3) \cup [3,\infty)\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Set-Builder Notation</strong></span><br>This is a method of specifying a set of elements that satisfy a certain<br>condition. It takes the form \({x| ... x}\) which reads as, "the set of all<br>x such that the statement about x is true."<br>\({x|4&lt;x\leq12}\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Interval Notation</strong></span><br>This is a way of describing sets that include all real numbers between a lower<br>limit that may or may not be included and an upper limit that may or may<br>not be included. The endpoint values are listed between brackets or<br>parentheses. A square bracket indicates inclusion in the set, and a<br>parenthesis indicates exclusion from the set. <br>\((4,12]\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Given a line graph, describe the set of values using interval notation.</strong></span><br>1. Identify the intervals to be included in the set by determining where the<br>heavy line overlays the real line.<br>2. At the left end of each interval, use [ with each end value to be included<br>in the set (solid dot) or a ( for each excluded end value (open dot).<br>3. At the right end of each interval, use ] with each end value to be included<br>in the set (filled dot) or ) for each excluded end value (open dot).<br>4. Use the union symbol \(\cup\) to combine all intervals into one set.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 5</strong></span><br>Describe the intervals of values shown using inequality notation,<br>set-builder notation, and interval notation. <br><br>Solution:<br>To describe the values, x, included in the intervals shown, we would say "x is<br>a real number greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 3, or a real<br>number greater than 5."<br>Inequality:  \(1 \leq x \leq 3 \text{ or} x &gt; 5\)<br>Set-Builder: \({x| 1 \leq x \leq 3 \text{ or} x &gt; 5}\)<br>interval:    \([1,3] \cup (5,\infty)\)<br>Remember that, when writing or reading interval notation, using a square<br>bracket means the boundary is included in the set. Using a parenthesis means<br>the boundary is not included in the set.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Finding Domain and Range From Graphs</strong></span><br>Another way to identify the domain and range of functions is by using graphs.<br>Because the domain refers to the set of possible input values, the domain of a<br>graph consists of all input values shown on the x-axis. The range is the<br>set of all possible values, which are shown on the y-axis. Keep in mind that<br>if the graph continues beyond the portion of the graph we can see, the domain<br>and range may be greater than the visible values. We can observe that the<br>graph extends horizontally from -5 to the right without bound, so the<br>domain is \([-5,\infty)\). The vertical extent of the graph is all range values<br>5 and below, so the range is \((-\infty, 5]. Note that the domain and range are<br>always written from smaller to larger values, or from left to right for domain,<br>and from the bottom of the graph to the top of the graph for range.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 6</strong></span><br>Find the domain and range of the function f whose graph is shown.<br><br>Solution:<br>We can observe that the horizontal extent of the graph is -3 to 1, so the domain<br>of f is (-3,1].<br>The vertical extent of the graph is 0 to -4, so the range is [-4,0].<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 7</strong></span><br>Find the domain and range of the function f whose graph is shown.<br><br>Solution:<br>The input quantity along the horizontal axis is years, which we represent with<br>the variable T for time. The output quantity is thousands of barrels a<br>per day, which we represent with the variable b for barrels. The graph may<br>continue to the left and right beyond what is viewed, but based on the portion<br>of the graph that is visible, we can determine the domain as \(1973 \leq t<br>\leq 2008\) and the range as approximately \(180 \leq b \leq 2010\).<br><br>In interval notation, the domain is [1973,2008] and the range is about<br>[180,2010]. for the domain and the range, we approximate the smallest<br>and largest values since they do not fall exactly on the grid lines. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Can a function's domain and range be the same?</strong></span><br>Yes. For example, the domain and range of the cube root function are both<br>the set of all real numbers. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Finding Domains and Ranges of the Toolkit Functions</strong></span><br>We will now return to our set of toolkit functions to determine the domain and<br>range of each.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Constant Function </strong></span><br>\(f(x)=c\)  <br>D=\((-\infty,\infty)\) : R=\([c,c]\)<br>For the constant function f(x)=c, the domain consists of all real numbers.<br>There are no restrictions on the input. The only output value is the<br>constant c, so the range is the set {c} that contains this single element. In<br>interval notation, this is written as [c,c], the interval that both begins<br>and ends with c.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Identity Function</strong></span><br>\(f(x)=x\)<br>D=\((-\infty,\infty)\) : R=\((-\infty,\infty)\)<br>For the identity function f(x)=x, there is no restriction on x. Both the<br>domain and and range are the set of all real numbers.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Absolute Function</strong></span><br>\(f(x)=|x|\)<br>D=\((-\infty,\infty)\) : R=\([0,\infty)\)<br>For the absolute value function, \(f(x)=|x|\), there is no restriction on x.<br>However, because absolute value is defined as a distance from 0, the<br>output can only be greater than or equal to 0.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Quadratic Function</strong></span><br>\(f(x)=x^2\)<br>D=\((-\infty,\infty)\) : R=\([0,\infty)\)<br>For the quadratic function \(f(x)=x^2\), the domain is all real numbers since<br>the horizontal extent of the graph is the whole real number line. Because the<br>graph does not include any negative value for the range, the range is only<br>nonnegative real numbers. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Cubic Function</strong></span><br>\(f(x)=x^3\)<br>D=\((-\infty,\infty)\) : R=\((-\infty,\infty)\)<br>For the cubic function \(f(x)=x^3\), the domain is all real numbers because the<br>horizontal extent of the graph is the whole real number line. The same<br>applies to the vertical extent of the graph, so the domain and range includes<br>all real numbers.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Reciprocal Function</strong></span><br>\(f(x)=\frac{1}{x}\)<br>D=\((-\infty,0) \cup (0,\infty)\) : R=\((-\infty,0) \cup (0,\infty)\)<br>We cannot divide by 0, so we must exclude 0 from the domain. further, 1<br>divided by any value can never be 0, so the range  also will not include 0.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Reciprocal Squared Function</strong></span><br>\(f(x)=\frac{1}{x^2}\)<br>D=\((-\infty,0) \cup (0,\infty)\) : R=\((0,\infty)\)<br>We cannot divide by 0, so we must exclude 0 from the domain. There is also no<br>x that can give an output of 0, so 0 is excluded from the range as well. Note<br>that the output of this function is always positive due to the square in the<br>denominator, so the range includes only positive numbers. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Square Root Function</strong></span><br>\(f(x)=\sqrt{x}\)<br>D=\([0,\infty)\) : R=\([0,\infty)\)<br>We cannot take the  square root of a negative real number, so the domain<br>must be 0 or greater. The range also excludes negative numbers because the<br>square root of a positive number x is defined to be positive, even though the<br>square of the negative number \(-\sqrt{x}\) also gives us x.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Cube Root Function</strong></span><br>\(f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}\)<br>D=\((-\infty,\infty)\) : R=\((-\infty,\infty)\)<br>The domain and range include all real numbers. Note that there is no problem<br>taking a cube root, or any odd-integer root, of a negative number, and the<br>resulting output is negative(it is an odd function).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Given the formula for a function, determine the domain and range</strong></span><br>1. Exclude from the domain any input values that result in division by 0.<br>2. Exclude from the domain any input values that have nonreal or undefined<br>number outputs.<br>3. Use the valid input values to determine the range of the output values.<br>4. Look at the function graph and table values to confirm the actual<br>function behavior.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 8</strong></span><br>Find the domain and range of \(f(x)=2x^3-x\)<br><br>Solution:<br>There are no restrictions on the domain, as any real number may be cubed and<br>then subtracted from the result. The domain is \((-\infty,\infty)\) and the<br>range is also \((-\infty,\infty)\).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 9</strong></span><br>Find the domain and range of \(f(x)=\frac{2}{x+1}\).<br><br>Solution:<br>We cannot evaluate the function at -1 because division by zero is undefined. The<br>domain is \((-\infty,-1)\cup(-1,\infty)\). Because the function is never 0, we<br>exclude 0 from the range. The range is \((-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty)\).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 10</strong></span><br>Find the domain and range of \(f(x)=2\sqrt{x+4}\).<br><br>We cannot take the square root of a negative number, so the value inside the<br>radical must be nonnegative.<br>\(x+4 \geq 0 \text{ when } x \geq -4\)<br>The domain of \(f(x) \text{ is } [-4,\infty)\).<br>We then find the range. We know that f(-4)=0, and the function value increases<br>as x increases without any upper limit. We conclude that the range of f is<br>\([0,\infty)\). <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Graphing Piecewise-Defined Functions</strong></span><br>Sometimes, we come across a function that requires more than one formula in<br>order to obtain the given output. For example, in the toolkit functions, we<br>introduced the absolute value function \(f(x)=|x|\). With a domain of all real<br>numbers and a range of values greater than or equal to 0, absolute value can be<br>defined as the magnitude, or modulus, of a real number value regardless of sign.<br>It is the distance from 0 on the number line. All of these definitions require<br>the output to be greater than or equal to 0.<br>If we input 0, or a positive value, the output is the same as the input.<br>\(f(x)=x \text{ if } x \geq 0\)<br>If we input a negative value, the output is the opposite of the input.<br>\(f(x)=-x \text{ if } x &lt; 0\)<br><br>Because this requires two different processes or pieces, the absolute<br>value function is an example of a piecewise function. A piecewise function is a<br>function in which more than one formula is used to define the output over<br>different pieces of the domain. <br><br>We use piecewise functions to describe situations in which a rule or<br>relationship changes as the input value crosses certain boundaries. For<br>example, we often encounter situations in business for which the cost per piece<br>of a certain item is discounted once the number ordered exceeds a certain<br>value. Tax brackets are another real-world example of piecewise functions. For<br>example, consider a simple tax system in which incomes up to $10,000 are taxed<br>at 10%, and any additional income is taxed at 20%. The tax on a total income S<br>would be \(0.1S \text{ if } S \leq 10,000 \text{ and } 1000+0.2(S-10000) \text{<br>if } S &gt; 1000\).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Piecewise Function</strong></span><br>A piecewise function is a function in which more than one formula is used to<br>define the output. Each formula has its own domain, and the domain of the<br>function is the union of all these smaller domains. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Given a piecewise function, write the formula and identify the domain for</strong></span><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>each interval.</strong></span><br>1.

We can<br>see that the price of gasoline in the table did not change by the same amount<br>each year, so the rate of change was not constant. If we use only the beginning<br>and ending data, we would be finding the average rate of change over the<br>specified period of time. To find the average rate of change, we divide the<br>change in the output value by the change in the input value.<br><br>Average rate of change=change in output/change in input<br>\(=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\)<br>\(\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\)<br>\(\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}\)<br><br>The Greek letter \(\Delta\) (delta) signifies the change in a quantity. We<br>read the ratio as "delta-y over delta-x" or "the change in y divided by<br>the change in x". Occasionally we write \(\Delta f\) instead of \(\Delta y\),<br>which still represents the change in the function's output value resulting<br>from a change to its input value. It does not mean we are changing the function<br>into some other function. <br><br>In our example, the gasoline price increased by $1.37 from 2005 to 2012.

We say that a function is<br>increasing on an interval if the function values increase as the input<br>increases within that interval. Similarly, a function is decreasing on an<br>interval if the function values decrease as the input values increase over that<br>interval. The average rate of change of an increasing function is positive, and<br>the average rate of change of a decreasing function is negative. <br><br>While some functions are increasing or decreasing over their entire domain, many<br>others are not. A value of the input where a function changes from increasing<br>to decreasing (as we go from left to right, that is, as the input variable<br>increases) is the location of a local maximum. The function value at that<br>point is the local maximum. If a function has more than one, we say it has<br>local maxima. Similarly, a value of the input where a function changes from<br>decreasing to increasing as the input variable increases is the location<br>of a local minimum. The function value at that point is the local minimum. The<br>plural form is local minima. Together, local maxima and local minima are<br>called local extrema, or local extreme values, of the function. The singular<br>form is extrenum. Often, the term local is replaced by the term relative.<br><br>Clearly, a function is neither increasing nor decreasing on an interval<br>where it is constant. A function is also neither increasing nor decreasing<br>at extrema. Note that we have to speak of local extrema, because any<br>given local extrenum as defined here is not necessarily the highest<br>maximum or lowest minimum in the function's entire domain.<br><br>For the function whose graph is shown, the local maximum is 16, and it<br>occurs at x=-2. The local minimum is -16 and it occurs at x=2.<br><br>To locate the local maxima and minima from a graph, we need to observe the<br>graph to determine where the graph attains its highest and lowest points,<br>respectively, within an open interval. Like the summit of a roller coaster, the<br>graph of a function is higher at a local maximum than at nearby points on both<br>sides. The graph will also be lower at a local minimum than at neighboring<br>points.

One method we<br>can employ is to adapt the basic graphs of the toolkit functions to build new<br>models for a given scenario. There are systematic ways to alter functions to<br>construct appropriate models for the problems we are trying to solve.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Identifying Vertical Shifts</strong></span><br>One simple kind of transformation involves shifting the entire graph of a<br>function up, down, right, or left. The simplest shift is a vertical shift,<br>moving the graph up or down, because this transformation involves<br>adding a positive or negative constant to the function. In other words,<br>we add the same constant to the output value of the function regardless of<br>the input. For a function \(g(x)=f(x)+k\), the function f(x) is shifted<br>vertically k units. To help visualize the concept of a vertical shift, consider<br>that \(y=f(x)\). Therefore, \(f(x)+k\) is equivalent to \(y+k\). Every unit of<br>y is replaced by \(y+k\), so the y-value increases or decreases depending on<br>the value of k. The result is a shift upward or downward.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Vertical Shift</strong></span><br>Given a function, f(x), a new function g(x)=f(x)+k where k is a constant, is<br>a vertical shift of the function f(x). All the output values change by k units.<br>If k is positive, the graph will shift up. If k is negative, the graph will<br>shift down. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span><br>Adding a Constant to a Function<br>To regulate temperature in a green building, airflow vents near the roof open<br>and close throughout the day.

Sketch a graph of<br>this new function. <br><br>Solution:<br>We can sketch a graph of this new function by adding 20 to each of the output<br>values of the original function. This will have the effect of shifting the<br>graph vertically up. Notice that for each input value, the output value has<br>increased by 20, so if we call the new function S(t), we could write<br>\(S(t)=V(t)+20\).<br><br>This notation tells us that, for any value of t, S(t) can be found by<br>evaluating the function V at the same input and then adding 20 to the result.<br>This defines S as a transformation of the function V, in this case a vertical<br>shift up 20 units.

We will now look at how changes to input, on the inside of the<br>function, change its graph and meaning. A shift to the input results in a<br>movement of the graph of the function left or right in what is known as a<br>horizontal shift.<br><br>For example, if \(f(x)=x^2\). then \(g(x)=(x-2)^2\) is a new function. Each<br>input is reduced by 2 prior to squaring the function. The result is that the<br>graph is shifted 2 units to the right, because we would need to increase<br>the prior input by 2 units to yield the same output value as given in f.<br><br>Horizontal Shift<br>Given a function, f, a new function g(x)=f(x-h), where h is a constant, is a<br>horizontal shift of the function f. If h is positive the graph will shift to<br>the right. If h is negative then the graph will shift to the left. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 3</strong></span><br>Adding a Constant to an Input<br>Returning to our building airflow example, suppose that in autumn the<br>facilities manager decides that the original venting plan starts too late, and<br>wants to begin the entire venting program 2 hours earlier.

For example, in the original function V, the<br>airflow starts to change at 8 am, whereas for the function F, the airflow<br>starts to change at 6 am. The comparable function values are V(8)=F=(6).<br>Notice also that the vents first opened top \(220 ft^2\) at 10 am under the<br>original plan, while under the new plan the vents reach \(220 ft^2\) at<br>8am, so V(10)=F(8). In both cases, we see that,. because F(t) starts 2<br>hours sooner, h=-2. That means that the same output values are reached when:<br>\(F(t)=V(t)-(-2)) = V(t+2)\)<br><br>Note that V(t+2) has the effect of shifting the graph to the left. Horizontal<br>changes affect the domain of a function instead of the range and often seem<br>counterintuitive. The new function F(t) uses the same outputs as V(t), but<br>matches those outputs to inputs 2 hours earlier than those of V(t). Said<br>another way, we must add 2 hours to the input of V to find the corresponding<br>output of F: F(t)=V(t+2).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Given a tabular function, create a new row to represent a horizontal</strong></span><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>shift.</strong></span><br>1.

To get the same output from the<br>function g, we will need an input value that is 3 larger. We input a value<br>that is 3 larger for g(x) because the function takes 3 away before evaluating<br>the function f.<br>\(g(5)=f(5-3)=f(2)=1\)<br><br>The result is that the function g(x) has been shifted to the right by 3.

For a quadratic, looking at the vertex point is convenient. In<br>the original function, f(0)=0. In out shifted function, g(2)=0. To<br>obtain the output value 0 from the function f, we need to decide whether a plus<br>or minus sign will work to satisfy g(2)=f(x-2)=f(0)=0. For this to work, we will<br>need to subtract 2 units form out input values.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 6</strong></span><br>Interpreting Horizontal versus Vertical Shifts<br>The function G(m) gives the number of gallons of gas required to drive m<br>miles.

Because<br>f(x) ends at (6,4) and g(x) ends at (2,4), we can see that the x-values have<br>been compressed to 1/3, because 6(1/3)=2. We might also notice that g(2)=f(6)<br>and g(1)=f(3). Either way, we can describe this relationship as g(x)=f(3x). This<br>is a horizontal compression by 1/3.<br><br>Notice that the coefficient needed for a horizontal stretch or compression is<br>the reciprocal of the stretch or compression. So, to stretch the graph<br>horizontally by a scale factor of 4, we need a coefficient of 1/4 in our<br>function: f(1/4(x)). This means that the input values must be 4 times larger to<br>produce the same result, requiring the input to be larger, causing the<br>horizontal stretching.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Performing a Sequence of Transformations</strong></span><br>When combining transformations, it is very important to consider the order of<br>the transformations. For example, vertically shifting by 3 and then vertically<br>stretching by 2 does not create the same graph as vertically stretching by 2 and<br>then vertically shifting by 3, because when we shift first, both the original<br>function and the shift get stretched, while only the original function gets<br>stretched when we stretch first.<br><br>When we see an expression such as 2f(x)+3, which transformation should we start<br>with? The answer here follows nicely from the order of operations. Given the<br>output value of f(x), we first multiply by 2, causing the vertical stretch, and<br>then add 3, causing the vertical shift. In other words, multiplication before<br>addition.<br><br>Horizontal transformations are a little trickier to think about. When we write<br>g(x)=f(2x+3), for example, we have to think about how the inputs to the function<br>g relate to the inputs to the function f. Suppose we know f(7)=12. What input to<br>g would produce that output? In other words, what value of x will allow<br>g(x)=f(2x+3)=12? We would need 2x+3=7. To solve for x, we would first subtract<br>3, resulting in a horizontal shift, and then divide by 2, causing a horizontal<br>compression. <br><br>This format ends up being very difficult to work with, because it is usually<br>much easier to horizontally stretch a graph before shifting. We can work around<br>this by factoring inside the function.<br>\(f(bx+p)=f(b(x+\frac{p}{b}))\)<br>So:<br>\(f(x)=(2x+4)^2\)<br>We can factor out a 2<br>\(f(x)=(2(x+2))^2\)<br>Now we can more clearly observe a horizontal shift to the left 2 units and a<br>horizontal compression.

If the value is negative then the point is below<br>the x-axis. If the point is positive then the point is above the x-axis. <br><br>6. Since the graph of r is below the x-axis for x&lt;-1 and is above the x-axis for<br>x&gt;1, the graph of r will approach the line y=x.

Since the real solutions of the equation 3x(x-1)=0 are<br>x=0 and x=1, the graph has two x-intercepts, 0 and 1.

The graph of r has the horizontal<br>asymptote y=3. To find out whether the graph of r intersects the asymptote, we<br>solve the equation r(x)=3.<br>\(r(x)=\frac{3x^2-3x}{x^2+x-12}=3\)<br>\(3x^2-3x=3x^2+3x-36\)<br>\(-6x=-36\)<br>\(x=6\)<br>The graph intersects the line y=3 only at x=6, and (6,3) is a point on the graph<br>of r.

Choose a number in each interval, solve<br>r(x) for each number chosen. If solution is positive then the point is above the<br>x-axis but if the solution is negative then the point is below the x-axis. <br><br>6. Since the graph of r is above the x-axis for x&lt;-4 and only crosses the line<br>y=3 at (6,3), as x approaches negative infinity the graph of r will approach the<br>horizontal asymptote y=3 from above. The graph of r will approach the vertical<br>asymptote x=-4 at the top to the left of x=-4 and at the bottom to the right of<br>x=-4. The graph of r will approach the vertical asymptote x=3 at the bottom to<br>the left of x=3 and at the top to the right of x=3. We do not know whether the<br>graph of r crosses or touches the line y=3 at (6,3).
