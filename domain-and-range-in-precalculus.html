We also need to consider what is<br>mathematically permitted. For example, we cannot include any input value<br>that leads us to take an even root of a negative number if the domain and<br>range consist of real numbers. Or in a function expressed as a formula,<br>we cannot include any input value in the domain that would lead us to divide<br>by 0.<br><br>We can visualize the domain as a holding area that contains raw materials<br>for a function machine and the range as another holding area for the<br>machine's products.<br><br>We can write the domain and range in interval notation, which uses<br>values within brackets to describe a set of numbers. In interval notation, we<br>use a square bracket when the set includes the endpoint and a<br>parenthesis to indicate the endpoint is either not included or the interval<br>is unbounded. For example, if a person has $100 to spend, they would need to<br>express the interval that is more than - and less than or equal to 100 and write<br>(0,100].<br><br>Let us turn our attention to finding the domain of a function whose equation<br>is provided. Oftentimes, finding the domain of such functions involves<br>remembering three different forms. First, if the function has no<br>denominator or an odd root, consider whether the domain could be all real<br>numbers. Second, if there is a denominator in the function's equation,<br>exclude values in the domain that force the denominator to be zero.<br>Third, if there is an even root, consider excluding values that would make<br>the radicand negative.<br><br>The smallest term from the interval is written first.<br>The largest term in the interval is written second, following a comma.<br>Parentheses are used to signify that an endpoint is not included, called<br>exclusive.<br>Brackets are used to indicate that an endpoint is included, called<br>inclusive.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span><br>Find the domain of the following function:<br>{(2,10), (3,10), (4,20), (5,30),(6,40)}<br><br>Solution:<br>First, identify the input values. The input value is the first coordinate in<br>an ordered pair. There are no restrictions, as the ordered pairs are simply<br>listed. The domain is the set of the first coordinates of the ordered pairs.<br>{2,3,4,5,6}<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 2</strong></span><br>Find the domain of the function \(f(x)=x^2-1\)<br><br>Solution:<br>The input value, shown by the variable x in the equation, is squared and<br>then the result is lowered by 1. Any real number may be squared and then be<br>lowered by 1, so there are no restrictions on the domain of this function.<br>The domain is the set of real numbers.<br>In interval form, the domain of f is: (-inf,inf)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 3</strong></span><br>Find the domain of the function: <br>\(f(x)=\frac{x+1}{2-x}\)<br><br>Solution:<br>When there is a denominator, we want to include only values that do not force<br>the denominator to be zero. So, we will set the denominator equal to 0<br>and solve for x.<br>\(2-x=0\)<br>\(-x=-2\)<br>\(x=2\)<br>Now, we will exclude 2 from the domain. The answers are all real numbers<br>where x&lt;2 or x&gt;2. We can use a symbol known as the union to combine the two<br>sets. In interval notation, we write the solution:<br>\((-\infty,2) \cup (2,\infty)\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 4</strong></span><br>Find the domain of the function \(f(x)=\sqrt{7-x}\).<br><br>Solution:<br>When there is an even root in the formula, we exclude any real numbers that<br>result in a negative number in the radicand.<br>Set the radicand greater than or equal to zero and solve for x<br>\(7-x \geq 0\)<br>\(-x \geq -7\)<br>\(x \leq 7\)<br>Now, we will exclude any number greater than 7 from the domain. The answers<br>are all real numbers less than or equal to 7.<br>\((-\infty,7)\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Can there be functions in which the domain and range do not intersect at all?</strong></span><br>Yes, for example, the function \(f(x)=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}\) has<br>the set of all positive real numbers as its domain but the set of all negative<br>real numbers as its range. As a more extreme example, a function's inputs and<br>outputs can be completely different categories, in such cases the domain and<br>range have no elements in common.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Using Notations to Specify Domain and Range</strong></span><br>In the previous examples, we used inequalities and lists to describe the<br>domain of functions. We can also use inequalities, or other statements that<br>might define sets of values or data, to describe the behavior of the variable<br>in set-builder notation. For example, \({x|10 \leq x &lt; 30}\) describes the<br>behavior of x in set-builder notation. The braces "{}" are read as "the set of",<br>and the vertical bar "|" is read as "such that" so we would read it as "the set<br>of x-values such that 10 is less than or equal to x, and x is less than 30."<br><br>Here are some examples of different notation:<br>\(5&lt;h\leq10\) : \({h|5&lt;h\leq10}\) : \(5,10]\)<br>\(5\leq h&lt;10\) : \({h|5\leq h&lt;10}\) : \([5,10)\)<br>\(5&lt;h&lt;10\)    : \({h|5&lt;h&lt;10}\)    : \((5,10)\)<br>\(h&lt;10\)      : \({h|h&lt;10}\)      : \((-\infty,10)\)<br>all numbers   : \({R}\)             : \((-\infty,\infty)\)<br><br>To combine two intervals using inequality notation or set-builder notation, we<br>use the word "or". As we saw in earlier examples, we use the union symbol,<br>\(\cup\), to combine two unconnected intervals. For example, the union of<br>sets {2,3,5} and {4,6} is the set {2,3,4,5,6}. It is the set of all elements<br>that belong to one or the other(or both) of the original two sets. For<br>sets with a finite number of elements like these, the elements do not have to<br>be listed in ascending order of numerical value. If the original two sets<br>have some elements in common, those elements should be listed only once in the<br>union set. For sets of real numbers on intervals, another example of a<br>union is: \({x| |x| \geq 3} = (-\infty,-3) \cup [3,\infty)\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Set-Builder Notation</strong></span><br>This is a method of specifying a set of elements that satisfy a certain<br>condition. It takes the form \({x| ... x}\) which reads as, "the set of all<br>x such that the statement about x is true."<br>\({x|4&lt;x\leq12}\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Interval Notation</strong></span><br>This is a way of describing sets that include all real numbers between a lower<br>limit that may or may not be included and an upper limit that may or may<br>not be included. The endpoint values are listed between brackets or<br>parentheses. A square bracket indicates inclusion in the set, and a<br>parenthesis indicates exclusion from the set. <br>\((4,12]\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Given a line graph, describe the set of values using interval notation.</strong></span><br>1. Identify the intervals to be included in the set by determining where the<br>heavy line overlays the real line.<br>2. At the left end of each interval, use [ with each end value to be included<br>in the set (solid dot) or a ( for each excluded end value (open dot).<br>3. At the right end of each interval, use ] with each end value to be included<br>in the set (filled dot) or ) for each excluded end value (open dot).<br>4. Use the union symbol \(\cup\) to combine all intervals into one set.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 5</strong></span><br>Describe the intervals of values shown using inequality notation,<br>set-builder notation, and interval notation. <br><br>Solution:<br>To describe the values, x, included in the intervals shown, we would say "x is<br>a real number greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 3, or a real<br>number greater than 5."<br>Inequality:  \(1 \leq x \leq 3 \text{ or} x &gt; 5\)<br>Set-Builder: \({x| 1 \leq x \leq 3 \text{ or} x &gt; 5}\)<br>interval:    \([1,3] \cup (5,\infty)\)<br>Remember that, when writing or reading interval notation, using a square<br>bracket means the boundary is included in the set. Using a parenthesis means<br>the boundary is not included in the set.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Finding Domain and Range From Graphs</strong></span><br>Another way to identify the domain and range of functions is by using graphs.<br>Because the domain refers to the set of possible input values, the domain of a<br>graph consists of all input values shown on the x-axis. The range is the<br>set of all possible values, which are shown on the y-axis. Keep in mind that<br>if the graph continues beyond the portion of the graph we can see, the domain<br>and range may be greater than the visible values. We can observe that the<br>graph extends horizontally from -5 to the right without bound, so the<br>domain is \([-5,\infty)\). The vertical extent of the graph is all range values<br>5 and below, so the range is \((-\infty, 5]. Note that the domain and range are<br>always written from smaller to larger values, or from left to right for domain,<br>and from the bottom of the graph to the top of the graph for range.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 6</strong></span><br>Find the domain and range of the function f whose graph is shown.<br><br>Solution:<br>We can observe that the horizontal extent of the graph is -3 to 1, so the domain<br>of f is (-3,1].<br>The vertical extent of the graph is 0 to -4, so the range is [-4,0].<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 7</strong></span><br>Find the domain and range of the function f whose graph is shown.<br><br>Solution:<br>The input quantity along the horizontal axis is years, which we represent with<br>the variable T for time. The output quantity is thousands of barrels a<br>per day, which we represent with the variable b for barrels. The graph may<br>continue to the left and right beyond what is viewed, but based on the portion<br>of the graph that is visible, we can determine the domain as \(1973 \leq t<br>\leq 2008\) and the range as approximately \(180 \leq b \leq 2010\).<br><br>In interval notation, the domain is [1973,2008] and the range is about<br>[180,2010]. for the domain and the range, we approximate the smallest<br>and largest values since they do not fall exactly on the grid lines. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Can a function's domain and range be the same?</strong></span><br>Yes. For example, the domain and range of the cube root function are both<br>the set of all real numbers. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Finding Domains and Ranges of the Toolkit Functions</strong></span><br>We will now return to our set of toolkit functions to determine the domain and<br>range of each.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Constant Function </strong></span><br>\(f(x)=c\)  <br>D=\((-\infty,\infty)\) : R=\([c,c]\)<br>For the constant function f(x)=c, the domain consists of all real numbers.<br>There are no restrictions on the input. The only output value is the<br>constant c, so the range is the set {c} that contains this single element. In<br>interval notation, this is written as [c,c], the interval that both begins<br>and ends with c.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Identity Function</strong></span><br>\(f(x)=x\)<br>D=\((-\infty,\infty)\) : R=\((-\infty,\infty)\)<br>For the identity function f(x)=x, there is no restriction on x. Both the<br>domain and and range are the set of all real numbers.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Absolute Function</strong></span><br>\(f(x)=|x|\)<br>D=\((-\infty,\infty)\) : R=\([0,\infty)\)<br>For the absolute value function, \(f(x)=|x|\), there is no restriction on x.<br>However, because absolute value is defined as a distance from 0, the<br>output can only be greater than or equal to 0.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Quadratic Function</strong></span><br>\(f(x)=x^2\)<br>D=\((-\infty,\infty)\) : R=\([0,\infty)\)<br>For the quadratic function \(f(x)=x^2\), the domain is all real numbers since<br>the horizontal extent of the graph is the whole real number line. Because the<br>graph does not include any negative value for the range, the range is only<br>nonnegative real numbers. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Cubic Function</strong></span><br>\(f(x)=x^3\)<br>D=\((-\infty,\infty)\) : R=\((-\infty,\infty)\)<br>For the cubic function \(f(x)=x^3\), the domain is all real numbers because the<br>horizontal extent of the graph is the whole real number line. The same<br>applies to the vertical extent of the graph, so the domain and range includes<br>all real numbers.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Reciprocal Function</strong></span><br>\(f(x)=\frac{1}{x}\)<br>D=\((-\infty,0) \cup (0,\infty)\) : R=\((-\infty,0) \cup (0,\infty)\)<br>We cannot divide by 0, so we must exclude 0 from the domain. further, 1<br>divided by any value can never be 0, so the range  also will not include 0.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Reciprocal Squared Function</strong></span><br>\(f(x)=\frac{1}{x^2}\)<br>D=\((-\infty,0) \cup (0,\infty)\) : R=\((0,\infty)\)<br>We cannot divide by 0, so we must exclude 0 from the domain. There is also no<br>x that can give an output of 0, so 0 is excluded from the range as well. Note<br>that the output of this function is always positive due to the square in the<br>denominator, so the range includes only positive numbers. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Square Root Function</strong></span><br>\(f(x)=\sqrt{x}\)<br>D=\([0,\infty)\) : R=\([0,\infty)\)<br>We cannot take the  square root of a negative real number, so the domain<br>must be 0 or greater. The range also excludes negative numbers because the<br>square root of a positive number x is defined to be positive, even though the<br>square of the negative number \(-\sqrt{x}\) also gives us x.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Cube Root Function</strong></span><br>\(f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}\)<br>D=\((-\infty,\infty)\) : R=\((-\infty,\infty)\)<br>The domain and range include all real numbers. Note that there is no problem<br>taking a cube root, or any odd-integer root, of a negative number, and the<br>resulting output is negative(it is an odd function).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Given the formula for a function, determine the domain and range</strong></span><br>1. Exclude from the domain any input values that result in division by 0.<br>2. Exclude from the domain any input values that have nonreal or undefined<br>number outputs.<br>3. Use the valid input values to determine the range of the output values.<br>4. Look at the function graph and table values to confirm the actual<br>function behavior.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 8</strong></span><br>Find the domain and range of \(f(x)=2x^3-x\)<br><br>Solution:<br>There are no restrictions on the domain, as any real number may be cubed and<br>then subtracted from the result. The domain is \((-\infty,\infty)\) and the<br>range is also \((-\infty,\infty)\).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 9</strong></span><br>Find the domain and range of \(f(x)=\frac{2}{x+1}\).<br><br>Solution:<br>We cannot evaluate the function at -1 because division by zero is undefined. The<br>domain is \((-\infty,-1)\cup(-1,\infty)\). Because the function is never 0, we<br>exclude 0 from the range. The range is \((-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty)\).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 10</strong></span><br>Find the domain and range of \(f(x)=2\sqrt{x+4}\).<br><br>We cannot take the square root of a negative number, so the value inside the<br>radical must be nonnegative.<br>\(x+4 \geq 0 \text{ when } x \geq -4\)<br>The domain of \(f(x) \text{ is } [-4,\infty)\).<br>We then find the range. We know that f(-4)=0, and the function value increases<br>as x increases without any upper limit. We conclude that the range of f is<br>\([0,\infty)\). <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Graphing Piecewise-Defined Functions</strong></span><br>Sometimes, we come across a function that requires more than one formula in<br>order to obtain the given output. For example, in the toolkit functions, we<br>introduced the absolute value function \(f(x)=|x|\). With a domain of all real<br>numbers and a range of values greater than or equal to 0, absolute value can be<br>defined as the magnitude, or modulus, of a real number value regardless of sign.<br>It is the distance from 0 on the number line. All of these definitions require<br>the output to be greater than or equal to 0.<br>If we input 0, or a positive value, the output is the same as the input.<br>\(f(x)=x \text{ if } x \geq 0\)<br>If we input a negative value, the output is the opposite of the input.<br>\(f(x)=-x \text{ if } x &lt; 0\)<br><br>Because this requires two different processes or pieces, the absolute<br>value function is an example of a piecewise function. A piecewise function is a<br>function in which more than one formula is used to define the output over<br>different pieces of the domain. <br><br>We use piecewise functions to describe situations in which a rule or<br>relationship changes as the input value crosses certain boundaries. For<br>example, we often encounter situations in business for which the cost per piece<br>of a certain item is discounted once the number ordered exceeds a certain<br>value. Tax brackets are another real-world example of piecewise functions. For<br>example, consider a simple tax system in which incomes up to $10,000 are taxed<br>at 10%, and any additional income is taxed at 20%. The tax on a total income S<br>would be \(0.1S \text{ if } S \leq 10,000 \text{ and } 1000+0.2(S-10000) \text{<br>if } S &gt; 1000\).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Piecewise Function</strong></span><br>A piecewise function is a function in which more than one formula is used to<br>define the output. Each formula has its own domain, and the domain of the<br>function is the union of all these smaller domains. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Given a piecewise function, write the formula and identify the domain for</strong></span><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>each interval.</strong></span><br>1. Identify the intervals for which different rules apply.<br>2. Determine formulas that describe how to calculate an output from an input<br>in each interval.<br>3. Use braces and if-statements to write the function.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 11</strong></span><br>Writing a Piecewise Function<br>A museum charges $5 per person for a guided tour with a group of 1-9 people or<br>a fixed $50 fee for a group of 10 or more people. Write a function relating<br>the number of people, n, to the cost, c.<br><br>Solution:<br>Two different formulas will be needed. For n-values under 10, c=5n.
