We can<br>see that the price of gasoline in the table did not change by the same amount<br>each year, so the rate of change was not constant. If we use only the beginning<br>and ending data, we would be finding the average rate of change over the<br>specified period of time. To find the average rate of change, we divide the<br>change in the output value by the change in the input value.<br><br>Average rate of change=change in output/change in input<br>\(=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\)<br>\(\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\)<br>\(\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}\)<br><br>The Greek letter \(\Delta\) (delta) signifies the change in a quantity. We<br>read the ratio as "delta-y over delta-x" or "the change in y divided by<br>the change in x". Occasionally we write \(\Delta f\) instead of \(\Delta y\),<br>which still represents the change in the function's output value resulting<br>from a change to its input value. It does not mean we are changing the function<br>into some other function. <br><br>In our example, the gasoline price increased by $1.37 from 2005 to 2012. Over 7<br>years, the average rate of change was:<br>\(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{$1.37}{7years} = 0.196 \text{ dollars per<br>year }\)<br>On average, the price of gas increased by about 19.6 cents per years.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Rate Of Change</strong></span><br>A rate of change describes how an output quantity changes relative to the<br>change in the input quantity. The units on a rate of change are "output units<br>per input units".<br>The average rate of change between two input values is the total change of the<br>function values (output values) divided by the change in the input values.<br>\(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}\)<br><br>Given the value of a function at different points, calculate the average<br>rate of change of a function for the interval between two values x1 and x2.<br>1. Calculate the difference of \(y_2-y_1=\Delta y\)<br>2. Calculate the difference of \(x_2-x_1=\Delta x\)<br>3. Find the ratio \(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span><br>Find the average rate of change of the price of gasoline between 2007 and<br>2009.<br><br>Solution:<br>In 2007, the price of gasoline was $2.84. In 2009, the cost was $2.41. The<br>average rate of change is:<br>\(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{2.41-2.84}{2009-2007} = \frac{-0.43}{2} =<br>-$0.22\) per year<br>Note that a decrease is expressed by a negative change or negative increase. A<br>rate of change is negative when the output decreases as the input increases or<br>when the output increases as the input decreases.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 2</strong></span><br>Computing average rate of change from a graph<br>Given the function g(t), find the average rate of change on the interval<br>[-1,2].<br><br>Solution:<br>At t=-1, the graph shows g(-1) =4. At t=2, the graph shows g(2)=1.<br>The horizontal change \(\Delta t= 3\) is shown by the red arrow, and the<br>vertical change \(\Delta g(t)=-3\) is shown by the blue arrow. The output<br>changes by -3 while the input changes by 3, giving an average rate of change<br>of:<br>\(\frac{1-4}{2-(-1)} = \frac{-3}{3} = -1 \)<br>Note that the order we choose is very important. If, for example, we use<br>\(\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_1-x_2}\), we will not get the correct answer. Decide<br>which point will be 1 and which point will be 2, and keep the coordinates<br>fixed as \((x_1,y_1)\) and \(x_2,y_2)\).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 3</strong></span><br>Computing Average Rate of Change from a Table<br>After picking up a friend who lives 10 miles away, anna records her distance<br>from home over time. The values are shown in the table. Find her average<br>speed over the first 6 hours.<br>t(hours)    =0  1  2  3   4   5   6   7<br>D(t)(miles) =10 55 90 153 214 240 292 300<br><br>Solution:<br>Here, the average speed is the average rate of change. She traveled 282 miles in<br>6 hours, for an average speed of:<br>\(\frac{292-10}{6-0} = \frac{282}{6} = 47\)<br>Because the speed is not constant, the average speed depends on the interval<br>chosen. For the interval[2,3], the average speed is 63 miles per hour.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 4</strong></span><br>Computing Average Rate of Change for a Function Expressed as a Formula<br>Compute the average rate of change of \(f(x)=x^2-\frac{1}{x}\) on the<br>interval [2,4].<br><br>Solution:<br>We can start by computing the function values at each endpoint of the interval.<br>\(f(2)=2^2-1/2 = 4-1/2 = 7/2\)<br>\(f(4)=4^2-1/4 = 16-1/4 = 63/4\)<br>Now we compute the average rate of change:<br>\(\frac{f(4)-f(2)}{4-2} = 49/8\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 5</strong></span><br>Finding the Average Rate of Change of a Force<br>The electrostatic force F, measured in newtons, between two charged<br>particles can be related to the distance between the particles d, in<br>centimeters, by the formula \(F(d)=\frac{2}{d^2}\). Find the average rate of<br>change of force if the distance between the particles is increased from 2 cm to<br>6 cm.<br><br>Solution:<br>We are computing the average rate of change of \(F(d)=\frac{2}{d^2}\) on<br>the interval [2,6].<br>Average rate of change:<br>\(\frac{F(6)-F(2)}{6-2} = \frac{(2/36)-(2/4)}{6-2} = \frac{-(16/36)}{4} =<br>-(1/9)\)<br>The average rate of change is -(1/9) newton per centimeter.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 6</strong></span><br>Finding an Average Rate of Change as an Expression<br>Find the average rate of change of \(g(t)=t^2+3t+1\) on the interval [0,a].<br>The answer will be an expression involving a.<br><br>Solution:<br>We use the average rate of change formula.<br>\(\frac{g(a)-g(0)}{a-0}\)<br>\(\frac{(a^2+3a+1)-(0^2+3(0)+1)}{a-0}\)<br>\(\frac{a^2+3a+1-1}{a} = \frac{a(a+3)}{a}=a+3\)<br>This result tells us the average rate of change in terms of "a" between t=0<br>and any other point t=a. For example, on the interval [0,5], the average rate<br>of change would be 5+3=8.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Using a Graph to Determine Where a Function is Increasing, Decreasing,</strong></span><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>or Constant</strong></span><br>As part of exploring how functions change, we can identify intervals over<br>which the function is changing in specific ways. We say that a function is<br>increasing on an interval if the function values increase as the input<br>increases within that interval. Similarly, a function is decreasing on an<br>interval if the function values decrease as the input values increase over that<br>interval. The average rate of change of an increasing function is positive, and<br>the average rate of change of a decreasing function is negative. <br><br>While some functions are increasing or decreasing over their entire domain, many<br>others are not. A value of the input where a function changes from increasing<br>to decreasing (as we go from left to right, that is, as the input variable<br>increases) is the location of a local maximum. The function value at that<br>point is the local maximum. If a function has more than one, we say it has<br>local maxima. Similarly, a value of the input where a function changes from<br>decreasing to increasing as the input variable increases is the location<br>of a local minimum. The function value at that point is the local minimum. The<br>plural form is local minima. Together, local maxima and local minima are<br>called local extrema, or local extreme values, of the function. The singular<br>form is extrenum. Often, the term local is replaced by the term relative.<br><br>Clearly, a function is neither increasing nor decreasing on an interval<br>where it is constant. A function is also neither increasing nor decreasing<br>at extrema. Note that we have to speak of local extrema, because any<br>given local extrenum as defined here is not necessarily the highest<br>maximum or lowest minimum in the function's entire domain.<br><br>For the function whose graph is shown, the local maximum is 16, and it<br>occurs at x=-2. The local minimum is -16 and it occurs at x=2.<br><br>To locate the local maxima and minima from a graph, we need to observe the<br>graph to determine where the graph attains its highest and lowest points,<br>respectively, within an open interval. Like the summit of a roller coaster, the<br>graph of a function is higher at a local maximum than at nearby points on both<br>sides. The graph will also be lower at a local minimum than at neighboring<br>points. These observations lead us to a formal definition of local<br>extrema.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Local Minima and Local Maxima</strong></span><br>A function f is an increasing function on an open interval if f(b)&gt;f(a) for<br>every two input values a and b in the interval where b&gt;a.<br>A function f is a descending function on an open interval if f(b)&lt;f(a) for<br>every two input values a and b in the interval where b&gt;a.<br>A function f has a local maximum at a point b in an open interval (a,c) if<br>\(f(b) \geq f(x)\) for every point x (x does not equal b) in the interval. F has<br>a local minimum at a point b in (a,c) if \(f(b) \leq f(x)\) for every point x<br>(x does not equal b) in the interval.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 7</strong></span><br>Finding increasing and Decreasing intervals on a Graph<br>Given the function p(t), identify the intervals on which the function<br>appears to be increasing.<br><br>Solution:<br>We see that the function is not constant on any interval. The function is<br>increasing where it slants upward as we move to the right and decreasing<br>where it slants downward as we move to the right. The function appears to be<br>increasing from t=1 to t=3 and from t=4 on.<br>In interval notation, we would say the function appears to be increasing<br>on the interval (1,3) and the interval (4,\infty).<br><br>Notice in this example that we used open intervals (intervals that do not<br>include the endpoints), because the function is neither increasing nor<br>decreasing at t=1, t=3, and t=4. These points are the local extrema(two minima<br>and a maximum).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 8</strong></span><br>Finding Local Extrema from a Graph<br>Graph the function \(f(x)=\frac{2}{x} + \frac{x}{3}\). Then use the graph to<br>estimate the local extrema of the function and to determine the intervals<br>on which the function is increasing.<br><br>Using technology, it appears there is a low point, or local minimum, between<br>x=2 and x=3, and a mirror-image high point, or local maximum, somewhere<br>between x=-3 and x=-2.<br><br>Most graphing calculators and graphing utilities can estimate the location of<br>maxima and minima. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 9</strong></span><br>Finding Local Maxima and Minima from a Graph<br>For the function f whose graph is shown, find all local maxima nd minima.<br><br>Solution:<br>Observe the graph of f. The graph attains a local maximum at x=1 because it<br>is the highest point in an open interval around x=1. The local maximum is the<br>y-coordinate at x=1, which is 2.<br>The graph attains a local minimum at x=-1 because it is the lowest point in an<br>open interval around x=-1. The local minimum is the y-coordinate x=-1, which is<br>-2.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Analyzing the Toolkit Functions for Increasing or Decreasing Intervals</strong></span><br>Constant Function <br>\(f(x)=c\)<br>Neither increasing nor decreasing<br><br>Identity Function <br>\(f(x)=x\)<br>Increasing<br><br>Quadratic Function<br>\(f(x)=x^2\)<br>Increasing on (0,inf)<br>Decreasing on (-inf,0)<br>Minimum at x=0<br><br>Cubic Function<br>\(f(x)=x^3\)<br>Increasing<br><br>Reciprocal Function<br>\(f(x)=\frac{1}{x}\)<br>Decreasing (-inf,0) union (0,inf)<br><br>Reciprocal Squared Function<br>\(f(x)=\frac{1}{x^2}\)<br>Increasing on (-inf,0)<br>Decreasing on (0,inf)<br><br>Cube Root Function<br>\(f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}\)<br>Increasing<br><br>Square Root Function<br>\(f(x)=\sqrt{x}\)<br>Increasing on (0,inf)<br><br>Absolute Value Function<br>\(f(x)=|x|\)<br>Increasing on (0,inf)<br>Decreasing on (-inf,0)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Use a Graph to Locate the Absolute Maximum and Absolute Minimum</strong></span><br>There is a difference between locating the highest and lowest points on a graph<br>in a region around an open interval(locally) and locating the highest and<br>lowest points on the graph for the entire domain. The y-coordinates (output) at<br>the highest and lowest points are called the absolute maximum and absolute<br>minimum, respectively.<br><br>To locate absolute maxima and minima from a graph, we need to observe the graph<br>to determine where the graph attains its highest and lowest points on the<br>domain of the function. Not every function has an absolute maximum or<br>minimum value. The function \(f(x)=x^3\) is one such function. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Absolute Maxima and Minima</strong></span><br>The absolute maximum of f at x=c is f(c) where \(f(c) \geq f(x)\) for all x in<br>the domain of f.<br>The absolute minimum of f at x=d is f(d) where \(f(d) \leq f(x)\) for all x in<br>the domain of f.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 10</strong></span><br>Finding Absolute Maxima and Minima from a Graph<br>For the function f, find all absolute maxima and minima.<br><br>Solution:<br>Observe the graph of f.
